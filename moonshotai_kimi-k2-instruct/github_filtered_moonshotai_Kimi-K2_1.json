  "1-1 (Weights)": "The only direct statement about weight availability says: \"Our model checkpoints are stored in block-fp8 format, you can find it on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct).\"  From this we learn that the Kimi-K2 parameters are (a) already uploaded, (b) hosted on Hugging Face under the repository name \"moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct\", and (c) saved in the specialised \"block-fp8\" numeric format.  The sentence is phrased in the present tense (\"are stored\", \"you can find\"), so the checkpoints are publicly reachable and can be downloaded directly from the indicated URL without any further access-control mechanism being described in the quotes.  No other quotes mention additional mirrors, shard layouts, size, or authentication requirements, so the Hugging Face repository and the block-fp8 format constitute the entirety of the weight-distribution details presently disclosed.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "The quote set contains no sentences that explicitly describe a public code repository, training scripts, data-processing pipelines, or configuration files for Kimi-K2.  The only indirect hint comes from a licensing line under item 1-3 that says \"Both the code and the model weights are released under the [Modified MIT License](LICENSE)\", which confirms that some form of code exists and is intended to be distributed under that license.  However, there is no URL, no Git commit, no folder path, and no description distinguishing training code from inference-only code.  Consequently, based solely on the provided material, we cannot point to any concrete location or content of the training pipeline or inference stack; we can only note that the license statement implies the authors intend the code to be available.",

  "1-3 (License)": "Several consecutive license excerpts establish that the project is governed by a \"Modified MIT License\".  The headline line reads: \"Both the code and the model weights are released under the [Modified MIT License](LICENSE).\"  The familiar MIT grant is reproduced verbatim: \"Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files ‚Ä¶ to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies ‚Ä¶\".  After this standard text, the authors insert one additional commercial-use provision: \"Our only modification part is that, if the Software (or any derivative works thereof) is used for any of your commercial products or services that have more than 100 million monthly active users, or more than 20 million US dollars ‚Ä¶ in monthly revenue, you shall prominently display \\\"Kimi K2\\\" on the user interface of such product or service.\"  In summary, all four classic MIT rights‚Äîuse, modification, redistribution, and commercial exploitation‚Äîremain permitted, but large-scale commercial deployments (‚â•100 M MAU or ‚â•$20 M monthly revenue) must visibly attribute the model by showing the name \"Kimi K2\" in the product UI.",
