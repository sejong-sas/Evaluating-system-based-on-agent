  "1-5 (Architecture)": "Kimi K2 is described in the quotes as a “state-of-the-art mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model.” The architecture activates 32 billion parameters for any given input while the total parameter pool across all experts reaches 1 trillion parameters, underscoring its large-scale MoE design. A configuration line explicitly labels the model with \"model_type\": \"kimi_k2\", confirming that these architectural characteristics belong to the Kimi K2 variant.",

The vocabulary resource is defined in the constant `VOCAB_FILES_NAMES = {\"vocab_file\": \"tiktoken.model\"}`, which shows that the core vocabulary resides in the file named `tiktoken.model`.",
