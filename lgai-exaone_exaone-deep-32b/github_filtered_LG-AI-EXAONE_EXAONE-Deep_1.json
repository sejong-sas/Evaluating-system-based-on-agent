  "1-1 (Weights)": "The available material repeatedly emphasizes that weight files for the LG-AI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep family are openly posted in several pre-quantized, ready-to-download formats. One quote states, \"We introduce a series of quantized weights of EXAONE Deep models,\" establishing that quantized checkpoints, not merely raw FP32 originals, are being distributed. More concretely, multiple sentences highlight AWQ compression: \"We provide AWQ-quantized weights of EXAONE Deep models, quantized using `AutoAWQ` library,\" and users are told to \"install the latest version of AutoAWQ library (`autoawq>=0.2.8`) to load the AWQ-quantized version of EXAONE Deep models.\" The official hosting locations are enumerated: a Hugging Face collection link – \"[EXAONE Deep collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/LGAI-EXAONE/exaone-deep-67d119918816ec6efa79a4aa)\" – serves the files directly, while an example CLI pull command is supplied: \"huggingface-cli download LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-GGUF \\\", implying anonymous or at least friction-free retrieval. In addition, \"EXAONE Deep models are uploaded to Ollama model library,\" signalling a second distribution channel. Taken together, the quotes confirm that (a) weights exist in several AWQ-compressed variants, (b) they are hosted publicly on Hugging Face and Ollama, and (c) acquisition requires nothing more than the standard Hugging Face CLI plus AutoAWQ ≥ 0.2.8 for inference, although the text does not explicitly state whether original full-precision checkpoints are also available or whether any gating or request form is needed beyond the illustrated download command.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "None of the supplied quotes mention source code, training scripts, data-preparation pipelines, configuration files, or even inference examples. Consequently, the excerpts give no evidence that training, fine-tuning, or evaluation code for LG-AI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep has been released, nor do they identify a repository, license, or access procedure for such code.",

  "1-3 (License)": "Licensing is governed by the \"EXAONE AI Model License Agreement 1.1 - NC,\" cited verbatim in two separate quotes. The text provides both the headline and key clauses. First, \"2.1 Grant of License\" furnishes a \"limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, and revocable license,\" indicating users may operate the model but within tight bounds. Second, the agreement is explicitly non-commercial: \"3.1 Commercial Use: The Licensee is expressly prohibited from using the Model, Derivatives, or Output for any commercial purposes, including but not limited to, developing or deploying products, services, or applications that generate revenue, whether directly or indirectly.\" Because the license is tagged \"NC,\" the non-commercial limitation is central. No additional clauses on modification, redistribution, or derivative works are quoted, so the excerpts confirm (a) permission for use is restricted and revocable, (b) commercial exploitation is disallowed, and (c) the agreement applies worldwide but is non-transferable.",

Therefore, the quotes offer no substantive bibliographic or URL data beyond asserting that an article entry for EXAONE-Deep has been reserved.",
