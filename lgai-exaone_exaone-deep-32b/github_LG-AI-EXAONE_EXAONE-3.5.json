You need to install `transformers>=4.43.0` for the EXAONE 3.5 models. The Latest version is recommended to use.\n\nHere is the example code to show how to use EXAONE 3.5 models.\n\n> [!Tip]\n> In all examples below, you can use another size model by changing 7.8B to 32B or 2.4B.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-3.5-7.8B-Instruct\"\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\n# Choose your prompt\nprompt = \"Explain how wonderful you are\"  # English example\nprompt = \"스스로를 자랑해 봐\"       # Korean example\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are EXAONE model from LG AI Research, a helpful assistant.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ninput_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=True,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    return_tensors=\"pt\"\n)\n\noutput = model.generate(\n    input_ids.to(\"cuda\"),\n    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n    max_new_tokens=128,\n    do_sample=False,\n)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> The EXAONE 3.5 instruction-tuned language models were trained to utilize the system prompt,\n> so we highly recommend using the system prompts provided in the code snippet above.\n\n<br>\n\n## Quantized Models\n\nWe introduce a series of quantized weights of EXAONE 3.5 models.\n\n### AWQ\n\nWe provide AWQ-quantized weights of EXAONE 3.5 models, quantized using `AutoAWQ` library. Please refer to the [AutoAWQ documentation](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) for more details.\n\nYou need to install the latest version of AutoAWQ library (`autoawq>=0.2.7.post3`) to load the AWQ-quantized version of EXAONE 3.5 models.\n\n```bash\npip install autoawq\n```\n\nYou can load the model in similar ways to the original models, only changing the model name. It automatically loads with AWQ configuration of the model. Please check the [Quickstart section](#quickstart) above for more details.\n\n### GGUF\n\nWe provide weights in `BF16` format and quantized weights in `Q8_0`, `Q6_K`, `Q5_K_M`, `Q4_K_M`, `IQ4_XS`. \n\nThe example below is for the 7.8B model in BF16 format. Please refer to the [EXAONE 3.5 collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/LGAI-EXAONE/exaone-35-674d0e1bb3dcd2ab6f39dbb4) to find quantized models. You may need to install `huggingface_hub` to download the GGUF weights.\n\n```bash\n# (optional) install huggingface_hub\npip install huggingface_hub\n\n# Download the GGUF weights\nhuggingface-cli download LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-3.5-7.8B-Instruct-GGUF \\\n    --include \"EXAONE-3.5-7.8B-Instruct-BF16*.gguf\" \\\n    --local-dir .\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Run Locally\n\nFor end users, we introduce two ways to run EXAONE 3.5 models locally. \n\n> [!Note]\n> We highly recommend to use repetition penalty not exceeding 1.0 for better generation quality.\n\n### llama.cpp\n\nYou can run EXAONE models with llama.cpp as follows:\n\n1. Install llama.cpp. Please refer to the [llama.cpp repository](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for more details.\n\n2.

The language model generates responses based on the output probability of tokens, and it is determined during learning from training data. While we have made every effort to exclude personal, harmful, and biased information from the training data, some problematic content may still be included, potentially leading to undesirable responses. Please note that the text generated by EXAONE language model does not reflects the views of LG AI Research.\n\n- Inappropriate answers may be generated, which contain personal, harmful or other inappropriate information.\n- Biased responses may be generated, which are associated with age, gender, race, and so on.\n- The generated responses rely heavily on statistics from the training data, which can result in the generation of\nsemantically or syntactically incorrect sentences.\n- Since the model does not reflect the latest information, the responses may be false or contradictory.\n\nLG AI Research strives to reduce potential risks that may arise from EXAONE language models. Users are not allowed\nto engage in any malicious activities (e.g., keying in illegal information) that may induce the creation of inappropriate\noutputs violating LG AI’s ethical principles when using EXAONE language models.\n\n<br>\n\n## License\n\nThe model is licensed under [EXAONE AI Model License Agreement 1.1 - NC](./LICENSE)\n \n<br>\n \n## Citation\n \n```\n@article{exaone-3.5,\n  title={EXAONE 3.5: Series of Large Language Models for Real-world Use Cases},\n  author={LG AI Research},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.04862},\n  year={2024}\n}\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Contact\nLG AI Research Technical Support: contact_us@lgresearch.ai\n",
