This guide is intended for more advanced users, and covers the underlying classes and methods, as well as the key concepts for understanding what‚Äôs actually going on when you chat with a model. The critical insight needed to understand chat models is this: All causal LMs, whether chat-trained or not, continue a sequence of tokens. When causal LMs are trained, the training usually begins with ‚Äúpre-training‚Äù on a huge corpus of text, which creates a ‚Äúbase‚Äù model. These base models are then often ‚Äúfine-tuned‚Äù for chat, which means training them on data that is formatted as a sequence of messages. The chat is still just a sequence of tokens, though! The list of role and content dictionaries that you pass to a chat model get converted to a token sequence, often with control tokens like &lt;|user|&gt; or &lt;|assistant|&gt; or &lt;|end_of_message|&gt; , which allow the model to see the chat structure. There are many possible chat formats, and different models may use different formats or control tokens, even if they were fine-tuned from the same base model! Don‚Äôt panic, though - you don‚Äôt need to memorize every possible chat format in order to use chat models. Chat models come with chat templates , which indicate how they expect chats to be formatted. You can access these with the apply_chat_template method. Let‚Äôs see two examples. Both of these models are fine-tuned from the same Mistral-7B base model: Mistral Zephyr Copied from transformers import AutoTokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained( &quot;mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1&quot; ) chat = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;I&#x27;m doing great. How can I help you today?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;I&#x27;d like to show off how chat templating works!&quot; }, ] tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize= False ) Copied &lt; s &gt; [INST] Hello, how are you? [/INST]I&#x27;m doing great. How can I help you today? &lt;/ s &gt; [INST] I&#x27;d like to show off how chat templating works! [/INST] Mistral-7B-Instruct uses [INST] and [/INST] tokens to indicate the start and end of user messages, while Zephyr-7B uses &lt;|user|&gt; and &lt;|assistant|&gt; tokens to indicate speaker roles. This is why chat templates are important - with the wrong control tokens, these models would have drastically worse performance. Using apply_chat_template The input to apply_chat_template should be structured as a list of dictionaries with role and content keys. The role key specifies the speaker, and the content key contains the message. The common roles are: user for messages from the user assistant for messages from the model system for directives on how the model should act (usually placed at the beginning of the chat) apply_chat_template takes this list and returns a formatted sequence. Set tokenize=True if you want to tokenize the sequence. Copied import torch from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained( &quot;HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta&quot; ) model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained( &quot;HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta&quot; , device_map= &quot;auto&quot; , dtype=torch.bfloat16) messages = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;system&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate&quot; ,}, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?&quot; }, ] tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize= True , add_generation_prompt= True , return_tensors= &quot;pt&quot; ) print (tokenizer.decode(tokenized_chat[ 0 ])) Copied &lt;|system|&gt; You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|user|&gt; How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting? &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|assistant|&gt; Pass the tokenized chat to generate() to generate a response. Copied outputs = model.generate(tokenized_chat, max_new_tokens= 128 ) print (tokenizer.decode(outputs[ 0 ])) Copied &lt;|system|&gt; You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|user|&gt; How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting? &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|assistant|&gt; Matey, I&#x27;m afraid I must inform ye that humans cannot eat helicopters. Helicopters are not food, they are flying machines. Food is meant to be eaten, like a hearty plate o&#x27; grog, a savory bowl o&#x27; stew, or a delicious loaf o&#x27; bread. But helicopters, they be for transportin&#x27; and movin&#x27; around, not for eatin&#x27;. So, I&#x27;d say none, me hearties. None at all. Some tokenizers add special &lt;bos&gt; and &lt;eos&gt; tokens. Chat templates should already include all the necessary special tokens, and adding additional special tokens is often incorrect or duplicated, hurting model performance. When you format text with apply_chat_template(tokenize=False) , make sure you set add_special_tokens=False if you tokenize later to avoid duplicating these tokens. This isn‚Äôt an issue if you use apply_chat_template(tokenize=True) , which means it‚Äôs usually the safer option! add_generation_prompt You may have noticed the add_generation_prompt argument in the above examples. This argument adds tokens to the end of the chat that indicate the start of an assistant response. Remember: Beneath all the chat abstractions, chat models are still just language models that continue a sequence of tokens! If you include tokens that tell it that it‚Äôs now in an assistant response, it will correctly write a response, but if you don‚Äôt include these tokens, the model may get confused and do something strange, like continuing the user‚Äôs message instead of replying to it! Let‚Äôs see an example to understand what add_generation_prompt is actually doing. First, let‚Äôs format a chat without add_generation_prompt : Copied tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize= False , add_generation_prompt= False ) tokenized_chat Copied &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Hi there!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;assistant Nice to meet you!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Can I ask a question?&lt;|im_ end|&gt; Now, let‚Äôs format the same chat with add_generation_prompt=True : Copied tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize= False , add_generation_prompt= True ) tokenized_chat Copied &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Hi there!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;assistant Nice to meet you!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Can I ask a question?&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;assistant When add_generation_prompt=True , &lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant is added at the end to indicate the start of an assistant message. This lets the model know an assistant response is next. Not all models require generation prompts, and some models, like Llama , don‚Äôt have any special tokens before the assistant response. In these cases, add_generation_prompt has no effect. continue_final_message The continue_final_message parameter controls whether the final message in the chat should be continued or not instead of starting a new one. It removes end of sequence tokens so that the model continues generation from the final message. This is useful for ‚Äúprefilling‚Äù a model response. In the example below, the model generates text that continues the JSON string rather than starting a new message. It can be very useful for improving the accuracy of instruction following when you know how to start its replies. Copied chat = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Can you format the answer in JSON?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;&#x27; }, ] formatted_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize= True , return_dict= True , continue_final_message= True ) model.generate(**formatted_chat) You shouldn‚Äôt use add_generation_prompt and continue_final_message together. The former adds tokens that start a new message, while the latter removes end of sequence tokens. Using them together returns an error. TextGenerationPipeline sets add_generation_prompt to True by default to start a new message. However, if the final message in the chat has the assistant role, it assumes the message is a prefill and switches to continue_final_message=True . This is because most models don‚Äôt support multiple consecutive assistant messages. To override this behavior, explicitly pass the continue_final_message argument to the pipeline. Model training Training a model with a chat template is a good way to ensure the template matches the tokens the model was trained on. Apply the chat template as a preprocessing step to your dataset. Set add_generation_prompt=False because the additional tokens to prompt an assistant response aren‚Äôt helpful during training. An example of preprocessing a dataset with a chat template is shown below. Copied from transformers import AutoTokenizer from datasets import Dataset tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained( &quot;HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta&quot; ) chat1 = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Which is bigger, the moon or the sun?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;The sun.&quot; } ] chat2 = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Which is bigger, a virus or a bacterium?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;A bacterium.&quot; } ] dataset = Dataset.from_dict({ &quot;chat&quot; : [chat1, chat2]}) dataset = dataset. map ( lambda x: { &quot;formatted_chat&quot; : tokenizer.apply_chat_template(x[ &quot;chat&quot; ], tokenize= False , add_generation_prompt= False )}) print (dataset[ &#x27;formatted_chat&#x27; ][ 0 ]) Copied &lt;|user|&gt; Which is bigger, the moon or the sun? &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|assistant|&gt; The sun. &lt;/ s &gt; After this step, you can continue following the training recipe for causal language models using the formatted_chat column. &lt; &gt; Update on GitHub ‚Üê Chat basics Multimodal chat templates ‚Üí Chat templates Using apply_chat_template add_generation_prompt continue_final_message Model training ",

Hu , Yelong Shen , Phillip Wallis , Zeyuan Allen-Zhu , Yuanzhi Li , Shean Wang , Lu Wang , Weizhu Chen View a PDF of the paper titled LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models, by Edward J. Hu and 7 other authors View PDF Abstract: An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at this https URL .

This guide is intended for more advanced users, and covers the underlying classes and methods, as well as the key concepts for understanding what‚Äôs actually going on when you chat with a model. The critical insight needed to understand chat models is this: All causal LMs, whether chat-trained or not, continue a sequence of tokens. When causal LMs are trained, the training usually begins with ‚Äúpre-training‚Äù on a huge corpus of text, which creates a ‚Äúbase‚Äù model. These base models are then often ‚Äúfine-tuned‚Äù for chat, which means training them on data that is formatted as a sequence of messages. The chat is still just a sequence of tokens, though! The list of role and content dictionaries that you pass to a chat model get converted to a token sequence, often with control tokens like &lt;|user|&gt; or &lt;|assistant|&gt; or &lt;|end_of_message|&gt; , which allow the model to see the chat structure. There are many possible chat formats, and different models may use different formats or control tokens, even if they were fine-tuned from the same base model! Don‚Äôt panic, though - you don‚Äôt need to memorize every possible chat format in order to use chat models. Chat models come with chat templates , which indicate how they expect chats to be formatted. You can access these with the apply_chat_template method. Let‚Äôs see two examples. Both of these models are fine-tuned from the same Mistral-7B base model: Mistral Zephyr Copied from transformers import AutoTokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained( &quot;mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1&quot; ) chat = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;I&#x27;m doing great. How can I help you today?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;I&#x27;d like to show off how chat templating works!&quot; }, ] tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize= False ) Copied &lt; s &gt; [INST] Hello, how are you? [/INST]I&#x27;m doing great. How can I help you today? &lt;/ s &gt; [INST] I&#x27;d like to show off how chat templating works! [/INST] Mistral-7B-Instruct uses [INST] and [/INST] tokens to indicate the start and end of user messages, while Zephyr-7B uses &lt;|user|&gt; and &lt;|assistant|&gt; tokens to indicate speaker roles. This is why chat templates are important - with the wrong control tokens, these models would have drastically worse performance. Using apply_chat_template The input to apply_chat_template should be structured as a list of dictionaries with role and content keys. The role key specifies the speaker, and the content key contains the message. The common roles are: user for messages from the user assistant for messages from the model system for directives on how the model should act (usually placed at the beginning of the chat) apply_chat_template takes this list and returns a formatted sequence. Set tokenize=True if you want to tokenize the sequence. Copied import torch from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained( &quot;HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta&quot; ) model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained( &quot;HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta&quot; , device_map= &quot;auto&quot; , dtype=torch.bfloat16) messages = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;system&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate&quot; ,}, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting?&quot; }, ] tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize= True , add_generation_prompt= True , return_tensors= &quot;pt&quot; ) print (tokenizer.decode(tokenized_chat[ 0 ])) Copied &lt;|system|&gt; You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|user|&gt; How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting? &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|assistant|&gt; Pass the tokenized chat to generate() to generate a response. Copied outputs = model.generate(tokenized_chat, max_new_tokens= 128 ) print (tokenizer.decode(outputs[ 0 ])) Copied &lt;|system|&gt; You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|user|&gt; How many helicopters can a human eat in one sitting? &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|assistant|&gt; Matey, I&#x27;m afraid I must inform ye that humans cannot eat helicopters. Helicopters are not food, they are flying machines. Food is meant to be eaten, like a hearty plate o&#x27; grog, a savory bowl o&#x27; stew, or a delicious loaf o&#x27; bread. But helicopters, they be for transportin&#x27; and movin&#x27; around, not for eatin&#x27;. So, I&#x27;d say none, me hearties. None at all. Some tokenizers add special &lt;bos&gt; and &lt;eos&gt; tokens. Chat templates should already include all the necessary special tokens, and adding additional special tokens is often incorrect or duplicated, hurting model performance. When you format text with apply_chat_template(tokenize=False) , make sure you set add_special_tokens=False if you tokenize later to avoid duplicating these tokens. This isn‚Äôt an issue if you use apply_chat_template(tokenize=True) , which means it‚Äôs usually the safer option! add_generation_prompt You may have noticed the add_generation_prompt argument in the above examples. This argument adds tokens to the end of the chat that indicate the start of an assistant response. Remember: Beneath all the chat abstractions, chat models are still just language models that continue a sequence of tokens! If you include tokens that tell it that it‚Äôs now in an assistant response, it will correctly write a response, but if you don‚Äôt include these tokens, the model may get confused and do something strange, like continuing the user‚Äôs message instead of replying to it! Let‚Äôs see an example to understand what add_generation_prompt is actually doing. First, let‚Äôs format a chat without add_generation_prompt : Copied tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize= False , add_generation_prompt= False ) tokenized_chat Copied &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Hi there!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;assistant Nice to meet you!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Can I ask a question?&lt;|im_ end|&gt; Now, let‚Äôs format the same chat with add_generation_prompt=True : Copied tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize= False , add_generation_prompt= True ) tokenized_chat Copied &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Hi there!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;assistant Nice to meet you!&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;user Can I ask a question?&lt;|im_ end|&gt; &lt;|im _start|&gt;assistant When add_generation_prompt=True , &lt;|im_start|&gt;assistant is added at the end to indicate the start of an assistant message. This lets the model know an assistant response is next. Not all models require generation prompts, and some models, like Llama , don‚Äôt have any special tokens before the assistant response. In these cases, add_generation_prompt has no effect. continue_final_message The continue_final_message parameter controls whether the final message in the chat should be continued or not instead of starting a new one. It removes end of sequence tokens so that the model continues generation from the final message. This is useful for ‚Äúprefilling‚Äù a model response. In the example below, the model generates text that continues the JSON string rather than starting a new message. It can be very useful for improving the accuracy of instruction following when you know how to start its replies. Copied chat = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Can you format the answer in JSON?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;&#x27; }, ] formatted_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize= True , return_dict= True , continue_final_message= True ) model.generate(**formatted_chat) You shouldn‚Äôt use add_generation_prompt and continue_final_message together. The former adds tokens that start a new message, while the latter removes end of sequence tokens. Using them together returns an error. TextGenerationPipeline sets add_generation_prompt to True by default to start a new message. However, if the final message in the chat has the assistant role, it assumes the message is a prefill and switches to continue_final_message=True . This is because most models don‚Äôt support multiple consecutive assistant messages. To override this behavior, explicitly pass the continue_final_message argument to the pipeline. Model training Training a model with a chat template is a good way to ensure the template matches the tokens the model was trained on. Apply the chat template as a preprocessing step to your dataset. Set add_generation_prompt=False because the additional tokens to prompt an assistant response aren‚Äôt helpful during training. An example of preprocessing a dataset with a chat template is shown below. Copied from transformers import AutoTokenizer from datasets import Dataset tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained( &quot;HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta&quot; ) chat1 = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Which is bigger, the moon or the sun?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;The sun.&quot; } ] chat2 = [ { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;user&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;Which is bigger, a virus or a bacterium?&quot; }, { &quot;role&quot; : &quot;assistant&quot; , &quot;content&quot; : &quot;A bacterium.&quot; } ] dataset = Dataset.from_dict({ &quot;chat&quot; : [chat1, chat2]}) dataset = dataset. map ( lambda x: { &quot;formatted_chat&quot; : tokenizer.apply_chat_template(x[ &quot;chat&quot; ], tokenize= False , add_generation_prompt= False )}) print (dataset[ &#x27;formatted_chat&#x27; ][ 0 ]) Copied &lt;|user|&gt; Which is bigger, the moon or the sun? &lt;/ s &gt; &lt;|assistant|&gt; The sun. &lt;/ s &gt; After this step, you can continue following the training recipe for causal language models using the formatted_chat column. &lt; &gt; Update on GitHub ‚Üê Chat basics Multimodal chat templates ‚Üí Chat templates Using apply_chat_template add_generation_prompt continue_final_message Model training ",

Hu , Yelong Shen , Phillip Wallis , Zeyuan Allen-Zhu , Yuanzhi Li , Shean Wang , Lu Wang , Weizhu Chen View a PDF of the paper titled LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models, by Edward J. Hu and 7 other authors View PDF Abstract: An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at this https URL .
