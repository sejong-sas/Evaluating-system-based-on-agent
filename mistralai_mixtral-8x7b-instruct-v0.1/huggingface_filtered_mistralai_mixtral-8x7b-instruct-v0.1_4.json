  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "The only statement available for Mixtral-8x7B Instruct v0.1 declares that this release is “a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance” and, crucially, that it “does not have any moderation mechanisms.” From this line we learn two things relevant to data filtering: (1) the checkpoint is presented as a rapid showcase of the model’s fine-tune-ability rather than the outcome of an extensive, multi-stage curation pipeline, and (2) the authors explicitly acknowledge the absence of any moderation or filtering components. In other words, no toxicity filters, safety classifiers, perplexity screens, deduplication thresholds, or similar criteria were applied; the model was released without built-in content-filtering safeguards.",
