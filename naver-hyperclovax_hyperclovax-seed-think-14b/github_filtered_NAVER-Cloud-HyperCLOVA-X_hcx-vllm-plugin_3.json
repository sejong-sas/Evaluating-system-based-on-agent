  "2-3 (API)": "The quotes indicate that NAVER-Cloud-HyperCLOVA-X/hcx-vllm-plugin is intended to be accessed through the vLLM \"plugin system.\" The link “https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/plugin_system.html” (quoted as “### How to use vLLM (Docs)”) shows there is public documentation that explains how the model integrates with vLLM. Installation instructions are extremely brief and concrete: after installing vllm, a single command – “pip install .” – registers the class “HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM” inside the vllm package, making the model callable through that framework. Deployment guidance is also documented: “### Deploying with vLLM Docker Example” points to “https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/deploying_with_docker.html,” implying that a ready-made Docker workflow exists for serving the model as an API-style service. Finally, usage code relies on the OpenAI-compatible protocol built into vLLM, as shown by the import line “from vllm.entrypoints.openai.protocol import ChatCompletionRequest, DeltaMessage,” confirming that once the plugin is registered, developers can issue ChatCompletion-style requests through the same schema. Altogether, the quotes collectively describe an accessible, documented path for exposing HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM through a vLLM-hosted, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, with both installation and Docker deployment examples publicly documented.",
