  "1-1 (Weights)__evidence": [],
  "1-2 (Code)": "All four code-related quotes explicitly concern the HCX plug-in’s integration with the vLLM inference framework. One line states: “After install vllm, `pip install .` to register `HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM` on vllm package.”  This indicates that once users have the vLLM library installed, running the standard Python package-installation command (`pip install .`) inside the plug-in’s source directory will auto-register the new model class HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM with vLLM, enabling inference through the vLLM engine.  The packaging metadata is shown in the setup script excerpt: `setup(name='vllm_add_hyperclovax_model',`, which clarifies that the distribution is published (or at least intended to be installed) under the project name “vllm_add_hyperclovax_model.”  Two further `entry_points` registrations appear in the quotes: `'register_hcx_reasoning_parser = parser:register_reasoning_parser'` and `'register_hcx_tool_parser = parser:register_tool_parser'`.  These lines reveal that the plug-in exposes additional command-line or programmatic parsers devoted to “hcx_reasoning” and “hcx_tool” functionality, respectively, suggesting custom extensions for prompt/tool handling.  None of the sentences mention any training pipeline, data-preparation scripts, or fine-tuning code; all references are squarely about inference‐time registration inside vLLM. Therefore, the only confirmed public code covers the plug-in’s installation, model-class registration, and auxiliary parser hooks, with no evidence of end-to-end training scripts being released.",

  "2-2 (Software)": "A single quote supplies software-related evidence:\n  \"entry_points={          'vllm.general_plugins': [              \\\"register_hyperclovax_model = model:register\\\",              \\\"register_hcx_reasoning_parser = parser:register_reasoning_parser\\\",              \\\"register_hcx_tool_parser = parser:register_tool_parser\\\"          ]      }\"\nFrom this, we can infer the following:\n• The project is packaged in Python and uses the standard `entry_points` mechanism (commonly declared in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`).  \n• A custom entry-point group named `vllm.general_plugins` is defined, indicating tight integration with the vLLM ecosystem.  \n• Three specific plugins are registered: (1) `register_hyperclovax_model`, which exposes the HyperCLOVA-X model itself to vLLM; (2) `register_hcx_reasoning_parser`, and (3) `register_hcx_tool_parser`, both of which appear to add HCX-specific parsing or post-processing functionality.  \n• All three plugins are mapped to Python callables (`model:register`, `parser:register_reasoning_parser`, `parser:register_tool_parser`) suggesting a modular design where model loading and specialized parsing logic are separated into distinct modules.  \n• While the quote does not explicitly name the core machine-learning framework (e.g., PyTorch) or distributed-training libraries (e.g., DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM), the presence of vLLM plugins implies the codebase is intended to interoperate with vLLM’s high-performance inference-oriented runtime, which itself is typically layered on top of PyTorch.  \n• The snippet pertains to environment configuration rather than the actual optimizer, scheduler, or training loop; thus no conclusions can be drawn about those aspects.  \nIn short, the available evidence only demonstrates that the model and its auxiliary parsers are exposed to the vLLM engine through Python entry-point registrations, reflecting a plugin-based integration strategy.",

  "2-3 (API)": "The quotes indicate that NAVER-Cloud-HyperCLOVA-X/hcx-vllm-plugin is intended to be accessed through the vLLM \"plugin system.\" The link “https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/plugin_system.html” (quoted as “### How to use vLLM (Docs)”) shows there is public documentation that explains how the model integrates with vLLM. Installation instructions are extremely brief and concrete: after installing vllm, a single command – “pip install .” – registers the class “HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM” inside the vllm package, making the model callable through that framework. Deployment guidance is also documented: “### Deploying with vLLM Docker Example” points to “https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/deploying_with_docker.html,” implying that a ready-made Docker workflow exists for serving the model as an API-style service. Finally, usage code relies on the OpenAI-compatible protocol built into vLLM, as shown by the import line “from vllm.entrypoints.openai.protocol import ChatCompletionRequest, DeltaMessage,” confirming that once the plugin is registered, developers can issue ChatCompletion-style requests through the same schema. Altogether, the quotes collectively describe an accessible, documented path for exposing HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM through a vLLM-hosted, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, with both installation and Docker deployment examples publicly documented.",
