A concrete, reproducible launch command is supplied: \"vllm serve mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503 --tokenizer_mode mistral --config_format mistral --load_format mistral --tool-call-parser mistral --enable-auto-tool-choice --limit_mm_per_prompt 'image=10' --tensor-parallel-size 2,\" which indicates that the model weights can be pulled directly by `vllm` from the Hugging Face hub under the repository name `mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503`.  In addition to the Mistral-native format, \"Transformers-compatible model weights are also uploaded (thanks a lot @cyrilvallez),\" confirming a second distribution format that works with the Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem.  A shard filename, \"model-00001-of-00010.safetensors,\" demonstrates that the actual checkpoints are released as a ten-part `safetensors` archive, which users can download piece-by-piece from the hub.  Together these quotes establish that publicly hosted, fully downloadable weight files exist in both Mistral and Transformers formats, and they can be accessed through standard clients such as `vllm` without additional gating.",

  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The architecture description for mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503 is limited but still highlights several key points. First, the model is explicitly said to “build upon Mistral Small 3 (2501),” so 3.1 (2503) is positioned as an evolutionary step rather than a complete redesign. The summary sentence notes two concrete architectural advances over its predecessor: the addition of “state-of-the-art vision understanding” and an extension of the usable context window “up to 128k tokens,” and it stresses that these gains come “without compromising text performance.” Second, the parameter count is given precisely: “24 billion parameters.” Taken together, the quotes tell us that mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503 is a 24 B-parameter multimodal model capable of handling very long context sizes (128 k tokens) while maintaining strong text quality, representing an incremental upgrade on the earlier 2501 release.",

  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "The only tokenizer detail provided states: “Utilizes a Tekken tokenizer with a 131k vocabulary size.” Therefore, mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503 uses the Tekken tokenizer and exposes a vocabulary of roughly 131 000 unique tokens, but no further downloadable or structural information is supplied in the available quotes.",

  "2-1 (Hardware)": "Hardware information is confined to deployment notes rather than training clusters. One sentence reports that “Mistral Small 3.1 can be deployed locally” and, when quantized, the model’s memory footprint is small enough to “fit within a single RTX 4090 or a 32 GB RAM MacBook.” Thus, while no large-scale training hardware is disclosed, the quote emphasizes the model’s efficiency and ‘knowledge-density,’ highlighting that even a 24 B-parameter system can run on modest consumer-grade GPUs or laptops when quantized.",

(1) Lineage: the 3.1 (2503) release is an incremental evolution of the earlier 3 (2501) checkpoint, implying that the underlying architecture and many training choices are retained while extensions are layered on top.  (2) Multimodality: the training corpus or objectives now encompass vision data, yielding “state-of-the-art vision understanding.”  (3) Context window: the training regime (data mixture, positional-embedding strategy, or memory-efficient attention technique) was modified so the model can process sequences as long as 128 000 tokens, a major jump in context length, and this boost comes “without compromising text performance,” suggesting that the optimization preserved or improved perplexity on textual benchmarks despite the huge window.",
