The instructions say that, after “downloading the model binaries, including the configuration files, to a local path (`/path/to/hyperclova-x-seed-think-14b`)” a user can load the weights with\n  model_name = \"naver-hyperclovax/HyperCLOVAX-SEED-Think-14B\"\n  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True, device_map=\"auto\")\nAlternatively, a one-line command – `vllm serve naver-hyperclovax/HyperCLOVAX-SEED-Think-14B --trust_remote_code` – exposes the model for inference. The repository contains sharded weight files such as “model-00001-of-00012.safetensors” as well as the corresponding index “model.safetensors.index.json”. The presence of these concrete filenames and the loading examples together indicate that anyone who can reach the Hugging Face repository can fetch the full 12-shard weight set together with configuration data and run it locally without further authentication keys or gated approval.",

Redistribution is allowed only if the distributor (i) passes along the Prohibited Use Policy, (ii) provides recipients with the same Agreement, (iii) marks modified files, (iv) includes the attribution notice: “HyperCLOVA X SEED 14B Think Model is licensed under the HyperCLOVA X SEED 14B Think Model License Agreement, Copyright © NAVER Corp.

Entities with more than “10 million monthly active users” or offering “any product or service … which is substantially similar to or directly competes with” NAVER’s must obtain a separate commercial license.  In addition, two source files that accompany the architecture comment: “# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0,” indicating that auxiliary implementation code is Apache 2.0 even though the model weights themselves fall under the bespoke HyperCLOVA X SEED license.
