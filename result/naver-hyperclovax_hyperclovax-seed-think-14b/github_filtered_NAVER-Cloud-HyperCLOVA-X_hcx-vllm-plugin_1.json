  "1-1 (Weights)": "No sentence in the provided material refers to the location of the NAVER-Cloud-HyperCLOVA-X/hcx-vllm-plugin checkpoints, whether the weights are downloadable, what access controls exist, or whether any third-party can obtain them. Consequently, based strictly on the available quotes, there is no public information about model-weight availability, hosting site, or distribution policy.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "All four code-related quotes explicitly concern the HCX plug-in’s integration with the vLLM inference framework. One line states: “After install vllm, `pip install .` to register `HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM` on vllm package.”  This indicates that once users have the vLLM library installed, running the standard Python package-installation command (`pip install .`) inside the plug-in’s source directory will auto-register the new model class HyperCLOVAXForCausalLM with vLLM, enabling inference through the vLLM engine.  The packaging metadata is shown in the setup script excerpt: `setup(name='vllm_add_hyperclovax_model',`, which clarifies that the distribution is published (or at least intended to be installed) under the project name “vllm_add_hyperclovax_model.”  Two further `entry_points` registrations appear in the quotes: `'register_hcx_reasoning_parser = parser:register_reasoning_parser'` and `'register_hcx_tool_parser = parser:register_tool_parser'`.  These lines reveal that the plug-in exposes additional command-line or programmatic parsers devoted to “hcx_reasoning” and “hcx_tool” functionality, respectively, suggesting custom extensions for prompt/tool handling.  None of the sentences mention any training pipeline, data-preparation scripts, or fine-tuning code; all references are squarely about inference‐time registration inside vLLM. Therefore, the only confirmed public code covers the plug-in’s installation, model-class registration, and auxiliary parser hooks, with no evidence of end-to-end training scripts being released.",
