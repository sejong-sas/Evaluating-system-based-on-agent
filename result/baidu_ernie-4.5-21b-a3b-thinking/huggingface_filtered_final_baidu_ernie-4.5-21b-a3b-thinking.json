The text also stresses cross-framework usability, noting that “Both PyTorch and PaddlePaddle ecosystem tools, such as vLLM, transformers, and FastDeploy, are expected to be able to load and run this model.”  Together, these quotes indicate that the full set of model parameters is publicly released in a format compatible with common open-source inference stacks.",

A supporting configuration line, “\"model_type\": \"ernie4_5_moe\",”, reiterates that the implementation is catalogued under an ‘ernie4_5_moe’ model type, anchoring the architecture within the ERNIE-4.5 family and confirming its MoE nature.",

Therefore, the entire API summary for this model consists solely of the confirmation that function-calling is officially supported.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "According to the source sentence, “ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking is a text MoE post-trained model, with 21B total parameters and 3B activated parameters for each token.”  This conveys several key pre-training characteristics.  First, the model is described as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) text model, meaning it is architected with multiple expert subnetworks and a gating mechanism that selects which experts participate in processing each token.  Second, the full parameter count is 21 billion, but only 3 billion parameters are actually activated on a per-token basis; this ratio highlights the sparse-activation property typical of MoE systems.  Third, it is identified as “post-trained,” indicating that the model has undergone an additional stage of training beyond its initial pre-training, although no further procedural details—such as data composition, training steps, or objective functions—are provided in the quoted material.  These three points constitute the totality of disclosed pre-training information.",
