  "1-1 (Weights)": "The repository for \"baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking\" explicitly states that it “releases Transformer-style weights.”  A concrete file example, “model-00001-of-00009.safetensors,” shows that the weights are distributed in multiple SafeTensors shards.  The text also stresses cross-framework usability, noting that “Both PyTorch and PaddlePaddle ecosystem tools, such as vLLM, transformers, and FastDeploy, are expected to be able to load and run this model.”  Together, these quotes indicate that the full set of model parameters is publicly released in a format compatible with common open-source inference stacks.",
