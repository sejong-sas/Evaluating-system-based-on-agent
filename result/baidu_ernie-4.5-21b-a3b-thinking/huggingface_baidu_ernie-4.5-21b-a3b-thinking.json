We are pleased to introduce **ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking**, featuring the following key enhancements:\n\n* **Significantly improved performance** on reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning, mathematics, science, coding, text generation, and academic benchmarks that typically require human expertise.\n* **Efficient tool usage** capabilities.\n* **Enhanced 128K long-context understanding** capabilities.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Note: This version has an increased thinking length. We strongly recommend its use in highly complex reasoning tasks.\n\n![benchmark](./benchmark.png)\n\n## Model Overview\n\nERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking is a text MoE post-trained model, with 21B total parameters and 3B activated parameters for each token. The following are the model configuration details:\n\n|Key|Value|\n|-|-|\n|Modality|Text|\n|Training Stage|Posttraining|\n|Params(Total / Activated)|21B / 3B|\n|Layers|28|\n|Heads(Q/KV)|20 / 4|\n|Text Experts(Total / Activated)|64 / 6|\n|Shared Experts|2|\n|Context Length|131072|\n\n## Quickstart\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To align with the wider community, this model releases Transformer-style weights. Both PyTorch and PaddlePaddle ecosystem tools, such as vLLM, transformers, and FastDeploy, are expected to be able to load and run this model.\n\n### FastDeploy Inference\n\nQuickly deploy services using FastDeploy as shown below. For more detailed usage, refer to the [FastDeploy GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FastDeploy).\n\n**Note**: 80GB x 1 GPU resources are required. Deploying this model requires FastDeploy version 2.2.\n\n```bash\npython -m fastdeploy.entrypoints.openai.api_server \\\n       --model baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking \\\n       --port 8180 \\\n       --metrics-port 8181 \\\n       --engine-worker-queue-port 8182 \\\n       --load_choices \"default_v1\" \\\n       --tensor-parallel-size 1 \\\n       --max-model-len 131072 \\\n       --reasoning-parser ernie_x1 \\\n       --tool-call-parser ernie_x1 \\\n       --max-num-seqs 32\n```\n\nThe ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking model supports function call.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://0.0.0.0:8180/v1/chat/completions\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-d $'{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"How \\'s the weather in Beijing today?\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"tools\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"function\",\n      \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Determine weather in my location\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"location\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"description\": \"The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n            },\n            \"unit\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"enum\": [\n                \"c\",\n                \"f\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"additionalProperties\": false,\n          \"required\": [\n            \"location\",\n            \"unit\"\n          ]\n        },\n        \"strict\": true\n      }\n    }]\n}'\n```\n\n### vLLM inference\n\n```bash\nvllm serve baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking\n```\n\nThe `reasoning-parser` and `tool-call-parser` for vLLM Ernie are currently under development.\n\n### Using `transformers` library\n\n**Note**: You'll need the`transformers`library (version 4.54.0 or newer) installed to use this model.\n\nThe following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_name = \"baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking\"\n\n# load the tokenizer and the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    device_map=\"auto\",\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n)\n\n# prepare the model input\nprompt = \"Give me a short introduction to large language model.\"\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n]\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], add_special_tokens=False, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=1024\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n\n# decode the generated ids\ngenerate_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(\"generate_text:\", generate_text)\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe ERNIE 4.5 models are provided under the Apache License 2.0.
