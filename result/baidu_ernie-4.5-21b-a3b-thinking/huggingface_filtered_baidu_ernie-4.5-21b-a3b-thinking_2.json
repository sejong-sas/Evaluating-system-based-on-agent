  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The available description states that “ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking is a text MoE post-trained model, with 21B total parameters and 3B activated parameters for each token.”  This clearly identifies the model as a mixture-of-experts (MoE) system in which only a subset of the full parameter set—3 billion of the 21 billion—participates in the computation for an individual token, a classic sparse-activation design.  A supporting configuration line, “\"model_type\": \"ernie4_5_moe\",”, reiterates that the implementation is catalogued under an ‘ernie4_5_moe’ model type, anchoring the architecture within the ERNIE-4.5 family and confirming its MoE nature.",

The first calls FastDeploy’s OpenAI-compatible API server from Python: \npython -m fastdeploy.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking.  The second invokes vLLM’s serving utility: \nvllm serve baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking.  These snippets show that both FastDeploy (via its entrypoints.openai.api_server module) and the vLLM framework are part of the software stack used to run the model, and that each tool loads the model directly from the same repository identifier.",
