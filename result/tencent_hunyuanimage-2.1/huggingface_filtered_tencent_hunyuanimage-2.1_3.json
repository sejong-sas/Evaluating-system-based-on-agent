  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "HunyuanImage-2.1 is introduced as a highly efficient text-to-image model capable of producing images at 2 K resolution (2048 × 2048). Its pre-training leverages an extensive dataset coupled with structured captions that are generated with the assistance of multiple expert models. This combination is reported to substantially improve the alignment between textual prompts and generated images, indicating that careful data curation and multi-model captioning strategies underpin the system’s overall performance.",
