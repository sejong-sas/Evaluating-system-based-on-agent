  "1-1 (Weights)": "The set of supplied quotations contains no mention at all of any public release, repository location, download mechanism, or access policy for the weights of the tencent/hunyuanimage-2.1 model. Because no sentence in the provided material addresses model checkpoints, binaries, or parameters, there is no evidence—positive or negative—about whether the weights are available, gated, or entirely private. Consequently, on the basis of the quotes alone, one must conclude that no information about weight availability is disclosed.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "None of the excerpts reference source code, scripts, configuration files, or training pipelines associated with HunyuanImage 2.1. There are no statements about open-sourcing, partial releases (e.g., fine-tuning only), or restrictions to inference-only code. Therefore, the provided material offers no insight into whether any part of the training or evaluation codebase is public or proprietary.",
  "1-3 (License)": "The quotations are completely silent on licensing terms. They do not name an OSI license, a custom end-user agreement, or any clause governing rights to use, modify, redistribute, or commercialize HunyuanImage 2.1 or its derivatives. As a result, no licensing information can be summarized from the supplied text.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "Only one direct reference to scholarly work appears: “Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges.” From this single sentence we can extract several points. First, there exists at least one technical report, paper, or experimental study that employs the HunyuanImage 2.1 model as a test bed. Second, that work investigates a method called “PromptEnhancer,” implying research into prompt-engineering or prompt-optimization techniques. Third, the experiments were sufficiently broad to be described as “extensive,” and they evaluated image–text alignment along multiple semantic and compositional axes, suggesting a thorough benchmark suite. Although the citation, venue, authors, and publication date are not included in the quote, the statement itself confirms the presence of a research document specifically focused on HunyuanImage 2.1 and its performance under PromptEnhancer. No additional papers, blogs, or technical reports are referenced in the provided material.",
