Finally, the metadata string ‚Äúextra_gated_eu_disallowed: true‚Äù indicates that access is explicitly gated for users in the European Union (and possibly other regions), confirming that although the weights are downloadable, geographic restrictions apply.  Taken together, the quotes confirm that official, pretrained weights for HunyuanImage-2.1 are available through the repository, can be downloaded via the linked checkpoint page, and are distributed in PyTorch-compatible *.safetensors format, but that the download portal enforces a gate that refuses requests originating from the EU (and presumably the UK and South Korea per the license, see Section 1-3).",
