  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The Falcon3 family of Open Foundation Models—including the 7B Instruct variant—is described as a set of pretrained and instruct LLMs that span sizes from 1 B to 10 B parameters. Within this family, the model is said to be \"Pretrained on 14 Teratokens of datasets comprising of web, code, STEM, high-quality and multilingual data using 1024 H100 GPU chips,\" indicating extremely large-scale data ingestion across diverse domains and a hardware footprint of 1024 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.",
