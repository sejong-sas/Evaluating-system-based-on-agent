  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The tiiuae/falcon3-7b-instruct model is described in the quotes as a \"Transformer based causal decoder only architecture\" that contains \"28 decoder blocks\" (also reported numerically as \"\\\"num_hidden_layers\\\": 28\").  To improve inference speed it employs \"Grouped query attention (GQA)\" with a split of \"12 query heads and 4 key value heads\".  Each attention head is noted to have a \"wider head dimension: 256\", giving the model relatively large per-head capacity compared with conventional designs.",

No additional structural information (such as BPE vs. unigram) is provided in the excerpt, but the numerical detail confirms that more than 130 k distinct token IDs are reserved and that this value is explicitly encoded in the tokenizer configuration file.",
