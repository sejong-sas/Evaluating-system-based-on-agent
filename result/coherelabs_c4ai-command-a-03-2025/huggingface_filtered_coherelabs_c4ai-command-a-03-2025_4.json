  "4-2 (Fine-tuning Data)": "According to the quoted material, once the base pre-training was complete the coherelabs/c4ai-command-a-03-2025 model underwent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference training. Both steps were aimed at aligning the systemâ€™s behavior with human preferences for helpfulness and safety. The source composition, concrete examples, or public availability of these fine-tuning datasets are not described in the provided quotes.",
