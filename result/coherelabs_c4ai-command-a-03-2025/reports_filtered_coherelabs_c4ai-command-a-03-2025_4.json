  "4-1 (Pre-training Data)": "The document provides one direct statement about the pre-training corpus: “Your name is Command. You have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.”  From this we can tell that the model’s pre-training set is explicitly multilingual, spanning at least 22 named languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, and Greek, plus Hebrew).  The statement also implies broader linguistic coverage (“the ability to speak many more languages”) even though those additional languages are not enumerated.  No further quantitative details—such as token counts, document counts, data sources, time span, licensing status, or domain composition—are revealed in the quote, so the only concrete insight offered is that the pre-training corpus is diverse in language scope.",
  "4-2 (Fine-tuning Data)": "Fine-tuning is summarized in a single sentence: “These capabilities have been trained into Command A via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning.”  This indicates that two distinct fine-tuning regimes were applied: (1) supervised fine-tuning (likely using labelled example–response pairs) and (2) preference fine-tuning (in which the system is optimized to match human or proxy preferences).  The quote does not disclose the origin, size, public availability, or concrete content of either dataset, nor does it identify any specific benchmark or domain coverage.  Therefore, the only detailed information we have is the high-level methodological split between supervised and preference-based fine-tuning.",
  "4-3 (Reinforcement Learning Data)": "The very same sentence—“These capabilities have been trained into Command A via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning.”—serves as the sole disclosure for reinforcement-learning data as well.  Its mention of “preference fine-tuning” implies that a reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback (RLHF) style dataset was used, but no particulars on data collection, annotator pool, reward-model construction, dataset scale, or licensing are provided.  All that is confirmed is that preference-driven optimization was part of the training pipeline.",
  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "No statements in the provided material mention any data filtering or cleaning tools, thresholds, classifiers, stages, or their measurable impact, so no information about data-filtering procedures is available.",
