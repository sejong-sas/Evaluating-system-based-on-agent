{
  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotations explicitly confirm that the model weights have been made publicly available: “Weights for both models have been released for research purposes.”  The model can be fetched under the identifier \"CohereForAI/c4ai-command-a-03-2025\", and example code illustrates direct download via the standard `from_pretrained` interface:\n  model_id = \"CohereForAI/c4ai-command-a-03-2025\"\n  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\nThe same statement notes that the release covers both Command A and Command R7B, which are architecturally similar.  No further details on checkpoints, size, or gating are supplied—only that the release is specifically “for research purposes.”",
  "1-2 (Code)": "No quotation mentions the availability of training, fine-tuning, or data-processing code.  There are no references to repositories, scripts, configuration files, or pipelines.  Consequently, the provided material contains no evidence that any part of the training code for the model has been published.",
  "1-3 (License)": "Licensing information is limited to the single statement: “Weights for both models have been released for research purposes.”  The quotes supply no formal license name (e.g., Apache-2.0, MIT), no version number, and no explicit clauses on use, modification, redistribution, or commercial rights.  The only clearly communicated restriction is the implied “research purposes” scope; all other licensing terms remain unspecified in the supplied text.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "The existence of an official report is confirmed by the title “Command A: An Enterprise-Ready Large Language Model.”  The accompanying line states: “In this report we describe the development of Command A, a powerful large language model purpose-built to excel at real-world enterprise use cases.”  These quotes establish that a dedicated document details the model’s development and enterprise orientation, but they do not provide a link, publication venue, date, or additional bibliographic data.",
