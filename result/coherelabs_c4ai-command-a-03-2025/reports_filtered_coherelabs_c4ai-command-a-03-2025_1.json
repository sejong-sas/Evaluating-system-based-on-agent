{
  "1-1 (Weights)": "The available information explicitly states that the model weights for the target model have been made public: “Weights for both models have been released for research purposes.”  Concrete evidence of where and how the community can obtain them is given through the code snippet that loads the artefacts directly from Hugging Face. The snippet specifies the exact repository slug — \"CohereForAI/c4ai-command-a-03-2025\" — and demonstrates that both the tokenizer and the causal-LM weights can be fetched with the standard `transformers` API (`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)` and `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)`). Taken together, these quotes confirm (a) the existence of downloadable checkpoint files, (b) open access for at least “research purposes,” and (c) the practical retrieval path (Hugging Face hub) under that model ID.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "No quotation mentions the release of any TRAINING-related code (data preparation scripts, configuration files, optimisation schedules, RL-HF loops, etc.). The only code shown is an inference example for loading the published weights, which does not constitute disclosure of the model’s training pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided material, there is no evidence that the authors have open-sourced the training code for this model.",
  "1-3 (License)": "The supplied quotes do not include any licence text, licence name, or wording about usage, redistribution, modification, commercial rights, or other legal conditions. Consequently, no licensing details can be summarised from the current evidence.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "Two identical references testify to the presence of an official technical report: “Title: Command A: An Enterprise-Ready Large Language Model,” followed by the abstract-style sentence, “In this report we describe the development of Command A, a powerful large language model purpose-built to excel at real-world enterprise use cases.” These lines confirm that (a) a formal document exists, (b) its focus is the development process of Command A, and (c) the paper positions the model specifically for enterprise scenarios. No additional bibliographic metadata (authors, venue, date, URL) is given in the quotes, but the existence and thematic scope of the report are clearly established.",
