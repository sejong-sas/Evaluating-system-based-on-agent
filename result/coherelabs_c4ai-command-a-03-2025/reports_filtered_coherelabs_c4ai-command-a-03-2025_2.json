  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The report states that Command A is a “powerful large language model” built for real-world enterprise scenarios. It is explicitly described as agent-optimised and multilingual, covering 23 global business languages. The only structural detail disclosed is that it uses a “novel hybrid architecture” whose intent is to balance computational efficiency with top-of-the-range performance. No additional hyper-parameters, layer counts, or component breakdowns are mentioned in the quoted material.",
  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "Code snippets show the tokenizer is distributed with the model on Hugging Face and can be loaded via:\nmodel_id = \"CohereForAI/c4ai-command-a-03-2025\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nThis indicates that a pretrained tokenizer artifact is publicly available under the same repository name and can be fetched programmatically with AutoTokenizer, but the quotes give no further details about its vocabulary size, byte-level handling, or special token configuration.",
  "2-1 (Hardware)": "",
  "2-2 (Software)": "The only training-software detail provided is that Command A was trained for summarization and the final step of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning. The excerpts do not disclose the core ML framework (e.g., PyTorch/JAX), distributed-training libraries, optimizer settings, or any other runtime configuration.",
