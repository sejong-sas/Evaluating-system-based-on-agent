  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The provided documentation repeatedly identifies the model as “c4ai-command-a-03-2025.” In the architecture bullet list, it explicitly states “Model Size: 111 billion parameters,” establishing that the network contains 111 B learnable weights. In the same list, as well as in a separate reiterated sentence, the text specifies a “Context length: 256K,” and restates that “Command A supports a context length of 256 K.” Taken together, these two facts give the entirety of the architectural detail disclosed in the quotes: (1) the parameter count of 111 B and (2) the extremely large maximum window of 256 000 tokens that the architecture is designed to accept in a single forward pass. No further layer‐wise, head‐count, or hyper-parameter breakdowns are present in the supplied excerpts.",

  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "All tokenizer information centers on how users should load and format messages for the target model. The snippet shows that messages should be prepared “with the c4ai-command-a-03-2025 chat template,” implying a dedicated prompt-formatting convention bundled with the release. Programmatically, the tokenizer is pulled directly from HuggingFace via:\n\nmodel_id = \"CohereLabs/c4ai-command-a-03-2025\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n\nThis line demonstrates that the tokenizer artefact is published under the same repository name on the Hub and can be downloaded with the standard AutoTokenizer class, suggesting compatibility with the Transformers ecosystem. The quote, however, does not reveal vocabulary size, model type (BPE, SentencePiece, etc.), or any special token details beyond the existence of a chat template.",

  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The only hardware-related statement given is that Cohere Labs positions Command A as “deployable on just two GPUs,” despite its 111 billion parameter scale. While framed in terms of deployment rather than training, this still conveys that the model can run inference on a dual-GPU setup, highlighting cost-effective operational requirements. No other specifics—such as GPU model (A100, H100, etc.), memory footprint, training cluster size, or total FLOPs—are disclosed in the provided material.",

Compared to other leading proprietary and open-weights models Command A delivers maximum performance with minimum hardware costs, excelling on business-critical agentic and multilingual tasks while‬ being deployable on just two GPUs."
