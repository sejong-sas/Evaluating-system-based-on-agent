  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The quotes state that the model explicitly identified as “c4ai-command-a-03-2025” (also referred to as Cohere Labs Command A) is an open-weights research release with 111 billion parameters. It is an auto-regressive transformer language model whose context window is 256 K tokens. Design details given in the quoted material describe four distinct attention layers: the first three layers rely on sliding-window attention with a window size of 4096 tokens and employ RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings) for relative positional encoding, while a fourth layer switches to global attention that completely removes positional embeddings so tokens can interact freely across the entire sequence. After the core pre-training, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference-based alignment to make its behaviour helpful and safe for enterprise use. In short, c4ai-command-a-03-2025 is a 111 B-parameter, 256 K-context, autoregressive transformer that combines sliding-window + RoPE attention with a final global-attention layer, then gains additional alignment through SFT and preference training.",
