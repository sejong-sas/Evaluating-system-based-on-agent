  "2-3 (API)": "The publicly-released model checkpoint \"CohereForAI/c4ai-command-a-03-2025\" can be accessed exactly like any other Hugging Face Hub model: the documentation shows a minimal Python snippet that loads the tokenizer and weights with `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)` and `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)`.  The authors also provide a full Hugging Face guide that covers how to \"run Command A in Hugging Face for Chat, RAG, Tool Use and Agents use cases\" and how to \"set system instructions for Command A\".  For chat-style interactions the recommended interface is the Transformers chat-template system: users call `apply_chat_template()` and pass a list of evidence passages through the dedicated `documents` parameter, thereby enabling “grounded generation in Command A.”  Taken together, the quotes confirm that an API-style, hosted workflow is supported (no local library hacking required), that concrete instructions and examples are already published, and that the same entry points let developers build classic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, function-calling single-shot tools, or multi-step agent loops on top of the exact 03-2025 checkpoint.",
  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The technical report explains that Command A was conceived as “a powerful large language model purpose-built to excel at real-world enterprise use cases.”  Its strong performance is attributed to a deliberately “decentralised training approach,” which combines self-refinement algorithms with explicit model-merging techniques.  An “original training pipeline” is laid out in detail in the report, after which an “extensive evaluation” demonstrates the benefits of the approach on enterprise-relevant public benchmarks.  Although the authors also discuss a sibling model called Command R7B in the same family (released for research and sharing architectural commonalities), the focus remains on the 03-2025 Command A checkpoint.  The text further stresses that the pre-training phase already imbues the model with domain-targeted competences: it \"has been trained specifically for tasks like summarization and the final step of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),\" indicating that the upstream corpus and objectives were curated to support grounded generation scenarios.",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "After the core pre-training, Command A undergoes multiple post-training stages described as “a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning.”  This composite regimen is directly credited for teaching the model high-level behaviors such as enterprise-grade summarization and end-of-pipeline RAG answer generation.  The same process is repeated for more advanced agentic skills: the documentation says that conversational tool use, single-shot function calling, and iterative Plan → Action → Observation agent loops were also “trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template.”  Thus, the fine-tuning stage is characterized by two ingredients—labeled datasets for supervised objectives and preference-based feedback for alignment—and by explicit prompt engineering that standardizes how those capabilities are invoked.",
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "While no standalone RLHF section is provided, the authors repeatedly note that in addition to supervised updates, Command A received “preference fine-tuning.”  In current LLM practice this term typically denotes reinforcement-learning-style optimization (e.g., DPO or PPO on reward models derived from human preferences).  The quote directly ties that preference-based stage to the emergence of summarization and RAG competence, implying that the model’s final alignment loop relied on human-or-human-proxy preferences rather than purely generative log-prob objectives.  Therefore, the only reinforcement-learning-like detail disclosed is the existence of a preference-tuning pass that complements supervised fine-tuning; specific reward models, batch sizes, or hyperparameters are not enumerated in the source material.",
