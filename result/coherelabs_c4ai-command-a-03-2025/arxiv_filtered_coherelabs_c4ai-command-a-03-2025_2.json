  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The documentation repeatedly emphasises that command-a is built around a novel, hybrid architecture that was explicitly engineered to balance efficiency with top-tier performance.  A schematic of this design is provided (Figure 2), and the text explains that the model combines architectural components in such a way that it can handle very long sequences while using far less key-value (KV) cache memory than conventional full-attention designs.  Concrete numbers are supplied: at an 8 k context length, command-a needs only 75 % of the KV cache required by Llama 3 70 B Instruct, 23.8 % of that used by Llama 3 405 B Instruct, and 45.5 % of Mistral Large, illustrating the memory savings delivered by the hybrid layout.\n\nThe model size is clearly specified as 111 B parameters.  Even within this size class, the authors claim state-of-the-art results: Figure 6 shows that command-a achieves leading code-generation accuracy against models of similar or much larger size, and the “Command A Agent” variant pushes the performance frontier even farther while remaining at the same 111 B scale through tool-use integration.\n\nBeyond raw scale, the architecture is described as “agent-optimised” and “multilingual-capable,” with native support for 23 business-relevant languages.  The quoted material also stresses that the same core architecture underpins the model’s exceptional long-context reasoning benchmarks (Tables 21 & 22), confirming that these strengths emerge directly from structural choices rather than post-hoc fine-tuning.  Collectively, the quotes portray command-a as a single-tower, 111 B-parameter, hybrid-attention LLM that sets new efficiency and quality standards for enterprise deployments, especially in memory-strained scenarios and code-heavy workloads.",
  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "",
  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The available statements focus on the model’s inference footprint.  They indicate that command-a can be served on as little as two NVIDIA A100 or H100 GPUs, highlighting its computational frugality relative to competing models.  The text adds that this limited hardware requirement not only lowers computational overhead but also enables on-premise or private-cloud deployment while still delivering a high token throughput.  No further details about the hardware used during pre-training (e.g., total GPU count, cluster scale, or training FLOPs) are disclosed in the supplied quotations.",
