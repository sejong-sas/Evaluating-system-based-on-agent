  "1-2 (Code)": "Only one statement about code is provided: “Please install transformers from the source repository that includes the necessary changes for this model.”  This indicates that inference/serving support for c4ai-command-a-03-2025 requires a fork or branch of the Transformers library containing model-specific modifications.  The quotes give no information about the availability of any training, fine-tuning, or RLHF code, implying that such training code is not publicly released; only the modified inference library is referenced.",
