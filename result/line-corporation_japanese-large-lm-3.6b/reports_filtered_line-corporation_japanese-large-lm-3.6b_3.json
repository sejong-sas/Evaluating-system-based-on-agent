  "2-3 (API)": "The provided material contains no statements that mention any public or private API, no references to endpoint documentation, usage examples, or availability status for the line-corporation/japanese-large-lm-3.6b model. Consequently, there is no information about an accessible API in the supplied quotes.",
  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The only explicit pre-training information states that LINE Corporation trained and publicly released two Japanese language models: a 3.6 billion-parameter variant (the target \"3.6B\" model) and a 1.7 billion-parameter variant. The authors present these as the outcome of their language-model construction effort and intend to share the know-how gained during the process. Beyond the confirmation that full-scale pre-training was performed to obtain these parameter counts, the excerpt offers no further methodological specifics (e.g., data composition, number of tokens, optimizer, training steps, or compute budget).",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "A closing statement notes that, in addition to releasing the raw 1.7B and 3.6B models, the team plans to publish instruction-tuned versions \"in the near future\" so the models can generate more appropriate outputs for user instructions. This indicates forthcoming fine-tuning focused on instruction-following behavior but does not yet disclose concrete datasets, hyperparameters, or pipeline details.",
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "No excerpt references reinforcement-learning-based post-training (e.g., RLHF, DPO) for the 3.6B model or any related variant, so there is no information to summarize.",
