  "1-1 (Weights)": "The only directly relevant statement is the brief mention of \"using metaseq and generating predictions based on the prompt\".  This indicates that runnable checkpoints exist somewhere because the software can be invoked to produce model predictions, but the quote does not disclose where those weights are hosted, how to download them, or whether they are openly released.  No URL, access portal, request procedure, or size/version information is provided in the supplied excerpts.  Therefore, on the basis of the available quotes, one can only say that weights are evidently loadable for inference, but the public availability, licensing terms, or distribution mechanism of those weights remains unspecified.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "Multiple snippets explicitly show that TRAINING functionality is exposed within the public repository.  The quotes include:\n  • \"## Getting Started in Metaseq\" – an introductory heading that implies user-facing documentation is present.\n  • \"from metaseq.cli.train import cli_main as train_cli_main\" (appears twice) – demonstrates that a dedicated command-line entry point for training exists and can be imported from the Metaseq package, confirming that pre-training or fine-tuning scripts are distributed in source form.\n  • \"Launch with `python -m metaseq.cli.interactive_hosted` to run locally.\" (appears twice) – shows that an interactive inference/serving wrapper is also shipped.\nTaken together, the quotes confirm that the repository contains: (1) end-to-end training code (data preparation and training loop accessible via metaseq.cli.train), and (2) code for interactive inference.  Because these snippets are plain Python import/launch commands, the code is evidently open-sourced and directly usable without hidden binaries.  There is, however, no granular detail in the excerpts about configuration files, scheduler scripts, or exact training recipes—only that the CLI entry points are present.",
