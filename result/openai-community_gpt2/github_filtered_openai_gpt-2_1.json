No other restrictions, rate limits or gated-access mechanisms are mentioned in the supplied material.\nThus, the single quote establishes that GPT-2’s pretrained weights are publicly downloadable via an unauthenticated URL hosted by OpenAI.",

The quote does not distinguish between pre-training, fine-tuning, or inference scripts, but the words \"starting point\" and \"experiment\" strongly suggest that the repository contains at least some training-pipeline or model-handling code rather than being limited to an inference-only demo. No additional qualifiers, access restrictions, or component lists are provided in the given material.",
