    "readme": "# Grok 2\n\nThis repository contains the weights of Grok 2, a model trained and used at xAI in 2024.\n\n## Usage: Serving with SGLang\n\n- Download the weights. You can replace `/local/grok-2` with any other folder name you prefer.\n\n  ```\n  hf download xai-org/grok-2 --local-dir /local/grok-2\n  ```\n\n  You might encounter some errors during the download. Please retry until the download is successful.  \n  If the download succeeds, the folder should contain **42 files** and be approximately 500 GB.\n\n- Launch a server.\n\n  Install the latest SGLang inference engine (>= v0.5.1) from https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/\n\n  Use the command below to launch an inference server. This checkpoint is TP=8, so you will need 8 GPUs (each with > 40GB of memory).\n  ```\n  python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model /local/grok-2 --tokenizer-path /local/grok-2/tokenizer.tok.json --tp 8 --quantization fp8 --attention-backend triton\n  ```\n\n- Send a request.\n\n  This is a post-trained model, so please use the correct [chat template](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/97a38ee85ba62e268bde6388f1bf8edfe2ca9d76/python/sglang/srt/tokenizer/tiktoken_tokenizer.py#L106).\n\n  ```\n  python3 -m sglang.test.send_one --prompt \"Human: What is your name?<|separator|>\\n\\nAssistant:\"\n  ```\n\n  You should be able to see the model output its name, Grok.\n\n  Learn more about other ways to send requests [here](https://docs.sglang.ai/basic_usage/send_request.html).\n\n## License\n\nThe weights are licensed under the [Grok 2 Community License Agreement](https://huggingface.co/xai-org/grok-2/blob/main/LICENSE).",
