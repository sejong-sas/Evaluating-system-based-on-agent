We train our models mainly on the reasoning-specialized dataset that incorporates long streams of thought processes. Evaluation results show that our smaller models, EXAONE Deep 2.4B and 7.8B, outperform other models of comparable size, while the largest model, EXAONE Deep 32B, demonstrates competitive performance against leading open-weight models. All EXAONE Deep models are openly available for research purposes and can be downloaded from this https URL Comments: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.04862 , arXiv:2408.03541 Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.CL) ; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) Cite as: arXiv:2503.12524 [cs.CL] &nbsp; (or arXiv:2503.12524v2 [cs.CL] for this version) &nbsp; https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.12524 Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite Submission history From: Jinsik Lee [ view email ] [v1] Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:39:33 UTC (72 KB) [v2] Wed, 19 Mar 2025 07:09:24 UTC (72 KB) Full-text links: Access Paper: View a PDF of the paper titled EXAONE Deep: Reasoning Enhanced Language Models, by LG AI Research and 31 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) TeX Source Other Formats view license Current browse context: cs.CL &lt;&nbsp;prev &nbsp; | &nbsp; next&nbsp;&gt; new | recent | 2025-03 Change to browse by: cs cs.AI References &amp; Citations NASA ADS Google Scholar Semantic Scholar a export BibTeX citation Loading...
