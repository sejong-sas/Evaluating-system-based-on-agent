The latest version is recommended to use.\n\nHere is the example code to show how to use EXAONE Deep models.\n\n> [!Tip]\n> In all the examples below, you can use another size model by changing 7.8B to 32B or 2.4B.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TextIteratorStreamer\nfrom threading import Thread\n\nmodel_name = \"LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B\"\nstreaming = True    # choose the streaming option\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n    device_map=\"auto\"\n)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\n# Choose your prompt:\n#   Math example (AIME 2024)\nprompt = r\"\"\"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations:\n\\[\\log_2\\left({x \\over yz}\\right) = {1 \\over 2}\\]\\[\\log_2\\left({y \\over xz}\\right) = {1 \\over 3}\\]\\[\\log_2\\left({z \\over xy}\\right) = {1 \\over 4}\\]\nThen the value of $\\left|\\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\\right|$ is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

Please refer to the [EXAONE Deep collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/LGAI-EXAONE/exaone-deep-67d119918816ec6efa79a4aa) for pre-quantized weights, and the [AutoAWQ documentation](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) for more details.\n\nYou need to install the latest version of AutoAWQ library (`autoawq>=0.2.8`) to load the AWQ-quantized version of EXAONE Deep models.\n\n```bash\npip install autoawq\n```\n\nYou can load the model in similar ways to the original models, only changing the model name. It automatically loads with AWQ configuration of the model. Please check the [Quickstart section](#quickstart) above for more details.\n\n### GGUF\n\nWe provide weights in `BF16` format and quantized weights in `Q8_0`, `Q6_K`, `Q5_K_M`, `Q4_K_M`, `IQ4_XS`. \n\nThe example below is for the 7.8B model in BF16 format. Please refer to the [EXAONE Deep collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/LGAI-EXAONE/exaone-deep-67d119918816ec6efa79a4aa) to find quantized models. You may need to install `huggingface_hub` to download the GGUF weights.\n\n```bash\n# (optional) install huggingface_hub\npip install huggingface_hub\n\n# Download the GGUF weights\nhuggingface-cli download LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-GGUF \\\n    --include \"EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-BF16*.gguf\" \\\n    --local-dir .\n```\n\n## Run Locally\n\nFor end users, we introduce two ways to run EXAONE Deep models locally. \n\n> [!Note]\n> We highly recommend to use repetition penalty not exceeding 1.0 for better generation quality.\n\n### llama.cpp\n\nYou can run EXAONE models with llama.cpp as follows:\n\n1. Install llama.cpp. Please refer to the [llama.cpp repository](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for more details.\n\n2.

We recommend using TensorRT-LLM for the best performance. You can run EXAONE Deep models with TensorRT-LLM by following the instructions on [TensorRT-LLM EXAONE Example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/models/core/exaone).\n\n> [!Note]\n> When you convert EXAONE Deep models to TensorRT-LLM format, you may need to set the environment variable `TRTLLM_DISABLE_UNIFIED_CONVERTER=1`.\n\n> [!Note]\n> TensorRT-LLM also supports AWQ on their own methods.\n> If you want to use AWQ with TensorRT-LLM, please refer to the [AWQ section](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/models/core/exaone#groupwise-quantization-awq) in TensorRT-LLM EXAONE Example.\n\n### vLLM\n\nYou can easily run EXAONE Deep models with vLLM. \n\n1. Install vLLM (`vllm>=0.6.0`). Please refer to the [vLLM quickstart guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html) for more details.\n\n```bash\npip install vllm\n```\n\n2. Run the models with vLLM.\n\n```bash\nvllm serve LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B\n```\n\n3. Send a request with the following curl command after the server starts.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -d '{\n        \"model\": \"LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B\",\n        \"messages\": [\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How many golf balls can fit in a school bus?\"}\n        ],\n        \"max_tokens\": 30720,\n        \"temperature\": 0.6,\n        \"top_p\": 0.95\n    }'\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> If you want to serve GGUF quantized models with vLLM, please refer to the [vLLM GGUF documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/quantization/gguf.html).\n\n### SGLang\n\nYou can also run EXAONE Deep models with SGLang.\n\n1. Install SGLang. Please refer to the [SGLang documentation](https://sgl-project.github.io) for more details.\n\n2. Run the server with the following command.\n\n```bash\npython -m sglang.launch_server --model-path LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B \\\n    --port 30000 --host 0.0.0.0\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> In case of using EXAONE Deep 2.4B model, you need to install sglang>=0.3.6 and use `--attention-backend triton` option.\n>\n> Additionally, we are currently working on a PR to fix the incompatibility of flashinfer with EXAONE Deep 2.4B. \n> Please refer to the [PR](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/4064) for details.\n\n3. Send a request with the following curl command after the server starts.\n\n```bash\ncurl -s http://0.0.0.0:30000/v1/chat/completions \\\n    -d '{\n        \"model\": \"LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B\",\n        \"messages\": [\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How many golf balls can fit in a school bus?\"}\n        ],\n        \"max_tokens\": 30720,\n        \"temperature\": 0.6,\n        \"top_p\": 0.95,\n    }'\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Usage Guideline\n\nTo achieve the expected performance, we recommend using the following configurations:\n\n1. Ensure the model starts with `<thought>\\n` for reasoning steps. The model's output quality may be degraded when you omit it. You can easily apply this feature by using `tokenizer.apply_chat_template()` with `add_generation_prompt=True`. Please check the example code on [Quickstart](#quickstart) section.\n2. The reasoning steps of EXAONE Deep models enclosed by `<thought>\\n...\\n</thought>` usually have lots of tokens, so previous reasoning steps may be necessary to be removed in multi-turn situation. The provided tokenizer handles this automatically.\n3. Avoid using system prompt, and build the instruction on the user prompt. \n4. Additional instructions help the models reason more deeply, so that the models generate better output.\n    - For math problems, the instructions **\"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"** are helpful.\n    - For more information on our evaluation setting including prompts, please refer to our [Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12524).\n5. In our evaluation, we use `temperature=0.6` and `top_p=0.95` for generation. \n6. When evaluating the models, it is recommended to test multiple times to assess the expected performance accurately.\n\n<br>\n\n## Limitation\n\nThe EXAONE language model has certain limitations and may occasionally generate inappropriate responses. The language model generates responses based on the output probability of tokens, and it is determined during learning from training data. While we have made every effort to exclude personal, harmful, and biased information from the training data, some problematic content may still be included, potentially leading to undesirable responses. Please note that the text generated by EXAONE language model does not reflects the views of LG AI Research.\n\n- Inappropriate answers may be generated, which contain personal, harmful or other inappropriate information.\n- Biased responses may be generated, which are associated with age, gender, race, and so on.\n- The generated responses rely heavily on statistics from the training data, which can result in the generation of\nsemantically or syntactically incorrect sentences.\n- Since the model does not reflect the latest information, the responses may be false or contradictory.\n\nLG AI Research strives to reduce potential risks that may arise from EXAONE language models. Users are not allowed\nto engage in any malicious activities (e.g., keying in illegal information) that may induce the creation of inappropriate\noutputs violating LG AI's ethical principles when using EXAONE language models.\n\n<br>\n\n## License\n\nThe model is licensed under [EXAONE AI Model License Agreement 1.1 - NC](./LICENSE)\n \n<br>\n \n## Citation\n \n```\n@article{exaone-deep,\n  title={EXAONE Deep: Reasoning Enhanced Language Models},\n  author={{LG AI Research}},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.12524},\n  year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n<br>\n\n## Contact\nLG AI Research Technical Support: contact_us@lgresearch.ai\n",
