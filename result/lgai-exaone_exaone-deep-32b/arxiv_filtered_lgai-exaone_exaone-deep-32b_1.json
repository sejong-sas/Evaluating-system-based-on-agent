{
  "1-1 (Weights)": "The available statements indicate that the parameters for lgai-exaone/exaone-deep-32b are distributed without gate-keeping to anyone conducting research. One sentence explicitly states that “All EXAONE Deep models are openly available for research purposes and can be downloaded from https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE,” which confirms both openness (no application process or approval step is mentioned) and the hosting location (the ‘LGAI-EXAONE’ organisation page on Hugging Face). A second citation, “[8] LG AI Research. EXAONE-3.5-32B-Instruct … 2025,” shows that a concrete 32-billion-parameter checkpoint (the ‘EXAONE-3.5-32B-Instruct’ variant) is already published under the same namespace. Together these lines substantiate that (i) the deep 32 B weights exist, (ii) they reside on Hugging Face, (iii) the intended audience is ‘research’, and (iv) no paywall or private request mechanism is mentioned. No quote mentions any geographic or user-type exclusions, rate limits, or embargoes, so none can be asserted here.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "No excerpt references source code, scripts, configuration files, or repositories for pre-training, fine-tuning, or any other stage of the lgai-exaone/exaone-deep-32b training pipeline. Because the quote collection is silent, we cannot confirm the release of either full training code or inference-only examples. The safest conclusion from the provided material is that there is no public training code disclosed for the EXAONE Deep 32 B model.",
  "1-3 (License)": "Three sentences give the only licensing details. First, “Section B in the Appendix provides license information for using the EXAONE Deep models,” indicating that formal terms are bundled with the technical documentation. The next sentence names those terms: “EXAONE AI Model License Agreement 1.1 - NC,” where the “NC” tag signals a non-commercial clause. The final line tells users that by downloading or otherwise using the model they automatically accept the agreement. From these points we can infer: (a) Right of use – granted, but confined to the scope allowed by the NC licence (commercial exploitation is therefore disallowed). (b) Modification – not explicitly mentioned in the citations, so its permissibility is unknown. (c) Redistribution – likewise not referenced, leaving uncertainty about whether sharing derivatives or the raw weights is allowed. (d) Commercial use – implicitly prohibited by the “NC” designation. No wording about patent, warranty, or attribution obligations appears in the supplied material, nor any reference to a standard open-source licence (e.g., Apache-2.0).",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "Two sources establish the written record for the model family. A standalone title, “EXAONE Deep: Reasoning Enhanced Language Models,” signals a dedicated document that presumably focuses on the Deep series (which includes the 32 B checkpoint). A second reference, repeated twice, cites the arXiv preprint “EXAONE 3.5: Series of Large Language Models for Real-world Use Cases” (arXiv:2412.04862, 2024). The repeated listing implies that this 3.5-series paper is the principal technical report and likely covers model architecture, training corpus, evaluation, and deployment notes for derivatives such as exaone-deep-32b. No DOI, journal venue, or blog post is supplied beyond these citations, and no presentation slides or tutorials are mentioned.",
