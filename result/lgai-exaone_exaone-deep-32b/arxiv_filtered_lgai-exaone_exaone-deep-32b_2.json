  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The provided excerpts do not contain any sentences that describe architectural characteristics of lgai-exaone/exaone-deep-32b. No information is given about layer counts, hidden sizes, attention heads, parameter totals, or other structural design choices.",
  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "None of the quoted material mentions a tokenizer for lgai-exaone/exaone-deep-32b. There is no reference to the tokenizer’s name, vocabulary size, file format, or availability for download.",
  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The only hardware detail explicitly stated is that “the EXAONE Deep models are trained using NVIDIA H100 GPU clusters provided by Google Cloud Platform.” Beyond confirming the use of H100 accelerators hosted on GCP, the quotes supply no further data—such as GPU counts, node topology, or total compute hours—for lgai-exaone/exaone-deep-32b.",
  "2-2 (Software)": "Two sentences describe the training software stack for lgai-exaone/exaone-deep-32b. First, “We utilize SimPER [19] as the training algorithm for DPO and our designed GRPO [15] variant for Online RL,” establishing that SimPER is employed during the DPO phase and a custom GRPO variant during online reinforcement learning. Second, training is said to run on “NVIDIA H100 GPU clusters provided by Google Cloud Platform and NVIDIA NeMo Framework,” indicating that the NVIDIA NeMo framework supplies the primary distributed-training environment. No additional frameworks, libraries, version numbers, or configuration flags are disclosed in the provided quotes.",
