The excerpt set contains no statements about the kinds of corpora, their sizes, sources, licenses, or any other descriptive statistics. Therefore, no summary of pre-training data content, provenance, or permitted usage can be produced from the provided material.",

  "4-2 (Fine-tuning Data)": "The quote collection contains no sentences that mention, describe, or allude to any fine-tuning datasets for bigscience-workshop/xmtf. As a result, there is no information available about the sources, composition, size, or public accessibility of fine-tuning data, nor any illustrative examples thereof.",

  "4-3 (Reinforcement Learning Data)": "None of the supplied excerpts reference reinforcement-learning-specific data for bigscience-workshop/xmtf. Consequently, there is no basis for summarizing the composition, generation process, accessibility, or provenance of any RL datasets.",
  "4-3 (Reinforcement Learning Data)__evidence": [],
  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "The single quotation provided—\"detect_res = cld3.get_language(sentence)\"—shows that the data-filtering pipeline for bigscience-workshop/xmtf invokes the Compact Language Detector v3 (CLD3) at the sentence level. Each sentence is passed to cld3’s get_language function, yielding a language prediction stored in detect_res. While the excerpt does not spell out subsequent decision rules, its presence indicates a filtering step in which language identification results are used to accept, reject, or route data according to linguistic criteria. No additional numeric thresholds, class probabilities, Jaccard ratios, perplexity limits, or multi-stage filtering details are disclosed in the provided material.",
