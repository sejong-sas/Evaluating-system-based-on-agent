  "4-1 (Pre-training Data)": "The provided quote set contains no sentences that mention \"bloomz\" together with any facts about its pre-training corpus. As a result, the available material does not disclose the types of data, sources, licenses, quantities, or any other characteristics of the pre-training data used for BLOOMZ.",
  "4-1 (Pre-training Data)__evidence": [],
  "4-2 (Fine-tuning Data)": "The quotes indicate that BLOOMZ is obtained by fine-tuning the original BLOOM (and, in parallel work, mT5) on a cross-lingual, instruction-following task mixture referred to as xP3 (dataset identifier: \"bigscience/xP3\"). This mixture is expressly designed to teach the model to follow human instructions across dozens of languages. The fine-tuning procedure leverages the multilingual coverage of BLOOM and mT5 to produce BLOOMZ, a family of models that demonstrate zero-shot generalization to previously unseen tasks and languages. No further composition details, licensing terms, or example counts are provided beyond the identification of the xP3 dataset itself.",

  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "The quote set contains no BLOOMZ-specific sentences that describe data filtering or cleaning pipelines, tools, classifiers, threshold values, or the proportion of data removed. Therefore, no information can be reported on BLOOMZâ€™s data-filtering criteria or their impact on the final training corpus.",
