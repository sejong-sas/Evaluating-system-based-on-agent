  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The documentation that explicitly names the target model states: \"The Gemma-2 2b model can be run up to 6x faster by leveraging torch compile.\"  This sentence directly attributes a concrete runtime characteristic—an up-to-six-fold speed-up—to the google/gemma-2-2b-it architecture when the PyTorch compilation path is enabled.  A second sentence provides the only disclosed data-volume figure that also mentions the target size class: \"The 27B model was trained with 13 trillion tokens, the 9B model was trained with 8 trillion tokens, and 2B model was trained with 2 trillion tokens.\"  From that line, the relevant fragment for the 2 B variant is that the model \"was trained with 2 trillion tokens.\"  Taken together, these two quotes yield all public architectural and design details: the model belongs to the 2-billion-parameter class, achieves up to a 6× speed-up under torch compile, and was pre-trained on a corpus containing approximately two trillion tokens.",
