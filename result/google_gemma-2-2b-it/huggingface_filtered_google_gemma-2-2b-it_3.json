  "2-3 (API)": "The only public conduit that is explicitly tied to gemma-2-2b-it is the open-source “local-gemma” GitHub repository. The project offers “a lightweight wrapper around Transformers for running Gemma 2 through a command line interface, or CLI.” In practice, this means that anyone who has the model weights on disk can launch an interactive prompt from a terminal and send requests directly to the Gemma runtime without needing any remote server, web dashboard, or proprietary endpoint. All interaction—model loading, prompt submission, and text generation—flows through this single CLI entry point, giving developers a self-contained, GPT-style experience while remaining entirely local.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "Pre-training statistics for gemma-2-2b-it are disclosed alongside the rest of the Gemma family: “the 2B model was trained with 2 trillion tokens.” The training run was executed on Google’s latest “TPUv5p” hardware and harnessed a modern JAX software stack coordinated through the “ML Pathways” distributed training system. In short, the 2-billion-parameter checkpoint consumed a 2-trillion-token corpus and was optimized on large-scale TPU infrastructure managed by JAX/Pathways, the same environment that underpins Google’s flagship research models.",
