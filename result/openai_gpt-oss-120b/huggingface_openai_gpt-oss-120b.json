Check out [`gpt-oss-20b`](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) for the smaller model.\n\n# Highlights\n\n* **Permissive Apache 2.0 license:** Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent risk—ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.  \n* **Configurable reasoning effort:** Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.  \n* **Full chain-of-thought:** Gain complete access to the model’s reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs. It’s not intended to be shown to end users.  \n* **Fine-tunable:** Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning.\n* **Agentic capabilities:** Use the models’ native capabilities for function calling, [web browsing](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#browser), [Python code execution](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#python), and Structured Outputs.\n* **MXFP4 quantization:** The models were post-trained with MXFP4 quantization of the MoE weights, making `gpt-oss-120b` run on a single 80GB GPU (like NVIDIA H100 or AMD MI300X) and the `gpt-oss-20b` model run within 16GB of memory. All evals were performed with the same MXFP4 quantization.\n\n---\n\n# Inference examples\n\n## Transformers\n\nYou can use `gpt-oss-120b` and `gpt-oss-20b` with Transformers. If you use the Transformers chat template, it will automatically apply the [harmony response format](https://github.com/openai/harmony). If you use `model.generate` directly, you need to apply the harmony format manually using the chat template or use our [openai-harmony](https://github.com/openai/harmony) package.\n\nTo get started, install the necessary dependencies to setup your environment:\n\n```\npip install -U transformers kernels torch \n```\n\nOnce, setup you can proceed to run the model by running the snippet below:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport torch\n\nmodel_id = \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\"\n\npipe = pipeline(\n    \"text-generation\",\n    model=model_id,\n    torch_dtype=\"auto\",\n    device_map=\"auto\",\n)\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Explain quantum mechanics clearly and concisely.\"},\n]\n\noutputs = pipe(\n    messages,\n    max_new_tokens=256,\n)\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"][-1])\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can run the model via [`Transformers Serve`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/serving) to spin up a OpenAI-compatible webserver:\n\n```\ntransformers serve\ntransformers chat localhost:8000 --model-name-or-path openai/gpt-oss-120b\n```\n\n[Learn more about how to use gpt-oss with Transformers.](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-transformers)\n\n## vLLM\n\nvLLM recommends using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency management. You can use vLLM to spin up an OpenAI-compatible webserver. The following command will automatically download the model and start the server.\n\n```bash\nuv pip install --pre vllm==0.10.1+gptoss \\\n    --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/gpt-oss/ \\\n    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128 \\\n    --index-strategy unsafe-best-match\n\nvllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b\n```\n\n[Learn more about how to use gpt-oss with vLLM.](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-vllm)\n\n## PyTorch / Triton\n\nTo learn about how to use this model with PyTorch and Triton, check out our [reference implementations in the gpt-oss repository](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss?tab=readme-ov-file#reference-pytorch-implementation).\n\n## Ollama\n\nIf you are trying to run gpt-oss on consumer hardware, you can use Ollama by running the following commands after [installing Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).\n\n```bash\n# gpt-oss-120b\nollama pull gpt-oss:120b\nollama run gpt-oss:120b\n```\n\n[Learn more about how to use gpt-oss with Ollama.](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/gpt-oss/run-locally-ollama)\n\n#### LM Studio\n\nIf you are using [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) you can use the following commands to download.\n\n```bash\n# gpt-oss-120b\nlms get openai/gpt-oss-120b\n```\n\nCheck out our [awesome list](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss/blob/main/awesome-gpt-oss.md) for a broader collection of gpt-oss resources and inference partners.\n\n---\n\n# Download the model\n\nYou can download the model weights from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/openai/gpt-oss-68911959590a1634ba11c7a4) directly from Hugging Face CLI:\n\n```shell\n# gpt-oss-120b\nhuggingface-cli download openai/gpt-oss-120b --include \"original/*\" --local-dir gpt-oss-120b/\npip install gpt-oss\npython -m gpt_oss.chat model/\n```\n\n# Reasoning levels\n\nYou can adjust the reasoning level that suits your task across three levels:\n\n* **Low:** Fast responses for general dialogue.  \n* **Medium:** Balanced speed and detail.  \n* **High:** Deep and detailed analysis.\n\nThe reasoning level can be set in the system prompts, e.g., \"Reasoning: high\".\n\n# Tool use\n\nThe gpt-oss models are excellent for:\n* Web browsing (using built-in browsing tools)\n* Function calling with defined schemas\n* Agentic operations like browser tasks\n\n# Fine-tuning\n\nBoth gpt-oss models can be fine-tuned for a variety of specialized use cases.\n\nThis larger model `gpt-oss-120b` can be fine-tuned on a single H100 node, whereas the smaller [`gpt-oss-20b`](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) can even be fine-tuned on consumer hardware.\n\n# Citation\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{openai2025gptoss120bgptoss20bmodel,\n      title={gpt-oss-120b & gpt-oss-20b Model Card}, \n      author={OpenAI},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2508.10925},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10925}, \n}\n```",
