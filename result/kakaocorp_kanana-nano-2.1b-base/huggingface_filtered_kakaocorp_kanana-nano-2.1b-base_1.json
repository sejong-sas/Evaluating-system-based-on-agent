A second quoted line, “#### Example Usage for `kanana-nano-2.1b-base`,” shows that the specific sub-model kakaocorp/kanana-nano-2.1b-base is included in the publicly listed artifacts and that users are given an example snippet for immediate use, further reinforcing that weights for this exact model variant are hosted and downloadable.",
