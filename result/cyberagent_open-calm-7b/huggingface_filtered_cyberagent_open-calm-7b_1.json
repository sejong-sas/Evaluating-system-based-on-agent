  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes show that the weights for the model identified exactly as \"cyberagent/open-calm-7b\" are openly downloadable from the Hugging Face Hub.  A code snippet demonstrates the standard loading call:  \"model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\\"cyberagent/open-calm-7b\\\", device_map=\\\"auto\\\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\", indicating that anyone with the transformers library can retrieve them directly.  The repository exposes two sharded binary checkpoints, explicitly listed as \"pytorch_model-00001-of-00002.bin\" and \"pytorch_model-00002-of-00002.bin\".  No authentication token, EULA gate, or other access restriction is mentioned in any quote, so the evidence points to freely accessible, public weights hosted in standard Hugging-Face format.",
