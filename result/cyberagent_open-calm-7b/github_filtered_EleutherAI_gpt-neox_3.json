  "2-3 (API)": "No sentences in the provided evidence mention any publicly accessible API, endpoint, documentation site, or usage example for GPT-NeoX or GPT-NeoX-20B. Consequently, the quotes supply no information about whether an inference or fine-tuning API exists, how it might be authenticated or invoked, or whether any public or private gateway offers model access. Therefore, nothing can be summarized about an API for EleutherAI/gpt-neox on the basis of the supplied text.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The evidence gives a fragmented but concrete picture of the GPT-NeoX pre-training setup.\n• Model scale and corpus: “GPT-NeoX-20B is a 20 billion parameter autoregressive language model trained on the Pile.” This establishes that the target checkpoint is a 20 B-parameter decoder-only transformer whose raw text corpus is The Pile (≈825 GB of diverse English-centric data).\n• Mixture-of-Experts option: “GPT-NeoX includes support for Dropless Mixture of Experts (DMoE) through the megablocks library.” Although not explicitly stating that the released 20 B model used DMoE, the quote shows the training codebase can enable a MoE variant by integrating the Megablocks kernel library.\n• Configuration interface: “GPT-NeoX parameters are defined in a YAML configuration file which is passed to the deepy.py launcher,” and the CLI help banner starts with “Arguments for gpt-neox. All of the following can be specified in your .yml config file(s).” Together, these lines clarify that every hyper-parameter—model dimension, learning schedule, data paths, optimizer, etc.—is supplied by a YAML spec and consumed by DeepSpeed’s deepy.py wrapper.\n• Dataset pipeline helpers: There is a built-in notion of a “GPT2 style dataset,” yet another line warns that “non gpt2 datasets are not currently unsupported with train_epochs,” implying that when users drive training via the `train_epochs` flag, only the GPT-2 binary-indexed dataset format is accepted; other dataset formats will fail.\n• Initialization utilities: Calls such as `initialize_megatron(neox_args, allow_no_cuda=False)` and a diagnostic print statement “> setting random seeds to {} ...” reveal that the codebase wires into the Megatron-LM framework, sets global RNG seeds for deterministic runs, and can enforce CUDA availability.\n• Training loop lineage: A comment, “From pretrain_gpt2:forward_step()”, indicates that the forward-and-loss computation in GPT-NeoX is directly borrowed or adapted from Megatron’s original `pretrain_gpt2` script.\nCollectively, the quotes depict a Megatron/DeepSpeed-based YAML-driven pipeline that trains a 20 B parameter autoregressive transformer on The Pile, optionally with DMoE, using GPT-2 style indexed datasets, deterministic seeding, and code that inherits from the `pretrain_gpt2` reference implementation.",
