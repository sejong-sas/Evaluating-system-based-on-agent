  "4-1 (Pre-training Data)": "The single available quote explicitly states that “GPT-NeoX-20B is a 20 billion parameter autoregressive language model trained on [the Pile].” From this, we can conclude that the entirety of the pre-training corpus for the EleutherAI/gpt-neox family model referenced here (GPT-NeoX-20B) is the Pile, a large, heterogeneous, publicly described text dataset. The quote further identifies the model as having 20 billion parameters and characterizes it as an autoregressive language model, but it offers no additional quantitative breakdown (e.g., token counts or source-domain splits) beyond that high-level statement. No other quotes provide further detail on types, quantities, permitted use, or composition of the pre-training data, so the information about pre-training data is limited to the fact that the Pile serves as the sole data source.",
