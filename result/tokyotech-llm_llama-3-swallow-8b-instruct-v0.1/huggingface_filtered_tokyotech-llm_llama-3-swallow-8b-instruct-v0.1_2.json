{
  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The available configuration snippets for tokyotech-llm/llama-3-swallow-8b-instruct-v0.1 explicitly list the architecture as \"LlamaForCausalLM\" and set \"model_type\" to \"llama\". Within the same block, the model is configured with exactly 32 hidden layers (\"num_hidden_layers\": 32) and 32 attention heads (\"num_attention_heads\": 32). Taken together, these lines confirm that the v0.1, 8-billion-parameter Swallow variant follows the standard Llama causal-language-model design while specifying a 32-layer, 32-head transformer backbone.",

One lists “Megatron-LM” as a key library, implying that the v0.1 Swallow model was trained or at least configured with this large-scale distributed-training framework.

Together these quotes identify Megatron-LM and Transformers 4.40.1 as core components of the software stack used for the model.",
