  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "The only filtering details present concern safety-oriented post-processing. The quotes state that additional classifiers can be deployed to screen both model inputs and outputs \"that are deemed unsafe,\" indicating a modular safety filter placed around the model. They also highlight PurpleLlama—described as a \"key component of Llama Stack\"—whose role is to address \"safety risks and inference-time mitigations.\" Together, these remarks show that the Llama 3 stack incorporates runtime safety filters, relying on dedicated classifiers (potentially including PurpleLlama) to block or sanitize content flagged as unsafe during inference.",
