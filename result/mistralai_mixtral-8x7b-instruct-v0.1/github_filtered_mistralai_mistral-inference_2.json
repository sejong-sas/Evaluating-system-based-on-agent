  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "All available lines point to the same family-specific tokenizer. The code snippets repeatedly import the class `MistralTokenizer` from the `mistral_common.tokens.tokenizers.mistral` module and then instantiate it directly from a local JSON vocabulary file. One example loads the tokenizer with `MistralTokenizer.from_file(\"./mistral-nemo-instruct-v0.1/tekken.json\")`, while others pass in a path assembled from `model_path` (e.g. `mistral_tokenizer = MistralTokenizer.from_file(str(model_path / tokenizer[0]))`). A helper call, `mistral_tokenizer: MistralTokenizer = load_tokenizer(Path(model_path))`, shows an alternate wrapper that resolves the same object, and the final reference (`tokenizer: Tokenizer = mistral_tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer`) illustrates that the raw tokenizer returned by the instruction-mode wrapper is the one ultimately exposed for tokenisation. Altogether the quotes make clear that the model family relies on the dedicated, downloadable \"MistralTokenizer\", loaded from a JSON file kept next to the model weights, with convenience helpers for both standard and instruction variants.",

  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The only explicit hardware details concern GPUs. One note states that a GPU is needed even for the installation step because `mistral-inference` pulls in the `xformers` package, and \"`xformers` itself needs a GPU for installation.\" A launch command is also provided—`torchrun --nproc-per-node 2 --no-python mistral-demo $M8x7B_DIR`—which shows the authors running two processes per node, implicitly mapping to two GPUs during execution. Nothing else about node count, accelerator model, or total compute is disclosed in the supplied text.",

A second quote adds that the `deploy` folder \"contains code to build a vLLM image with the required dependencies to serve the Mistral AI model,\" explicitly naming the vLLM runtime and implying a containerised deployment recipe. Beyond the presence of PyTorch-compatible `xformers` and the vLLM-based serving image, no additional libraries, versions, or distributed-training frameworks are mentioned.",
