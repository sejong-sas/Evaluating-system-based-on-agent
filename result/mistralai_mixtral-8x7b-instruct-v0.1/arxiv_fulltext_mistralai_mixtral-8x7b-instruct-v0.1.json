Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As\nit only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low\nbatch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward\nblock picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router\nnetwork chooses two of these groups (the “experts”) to process the token and combine their output\nadditively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and\nlatency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches\nor exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular,\narXiv:2401.04088v1  [cs.LG]  8 Jan 2024\n\nFigure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The\nlayer’s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard\nfeedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture.\nMixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require\nmultilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments\nshow that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens,\nregardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.\nWe also present Mixtral 8x7B – Instruct, a chat model fine-tuned to follow instructions using\nsupervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization [25]. Its performance notably surpasses\nthat of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B – chat model on human evaluation\nbenchmarks. Mixtral – Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment\nprofile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD.\nWe release both Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x7B – Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license1, free for\nacademic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications.\nTo enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to\nthe vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference. Skypilot also\nallows the deployment of vLLM endpoints on any instance in the cloud.\n2\nArchitectural details\nParameter\nValue\ndim\n4096\nn_layers\n32\nhead_dim\n128\nhidden_dim\n14336\nn_heads\n32\nn_kv_heads\n8\ncontext_len\n32768\nvocab_size\n32000\nnum_experts\n8\ntop_k_experts\n2\nTable 1: Model architecture.\nMixtral is based on a transformer architecture [31] and uses the same\nmodifications as described in [18], with the notable exceptions that Mix-\ntral supports a fully dense context length of 32k tokens, and the feed-\nforward blocks are replaced by Mixture-of-Expert layers (Section 2.1).\nThe model architecture parameters are summarized in Table 1.\n2.1\nSparse Mixture of Experts\nWe present a brief overview of the Mixture of Experts layer (Figure 1).\nFor a more in-depth overview, see [12]. The output of the MoE module\nfor a given input x is determined by the weighted sum of the outputs\nof the expert networks, where the weights are given by the gating\nnetwork’s output. i.e. given n expert networks {E0, Ei, ..., En−1}, the\noutput of the expert layer is given by:\nn−1\nX\ni=0\nG(x)i · Ei(x).\nHere, G(x)i denotes the n-dimensional output of the gating network for the i-th expert, and Ei(x)\nis the output of the i-th expert network. If the gating vector is sparse, we can avoid computing\nthe outputs of experts whose gates are zero. There are multiple alternative ways of implementing\nG(x) [6, 15, 35], but a simple and performant one is implemented by taking the softmax over the\nTop-K logits of a linear layer [28]. We use\nG(x) := Softmax(TopK(x · Wg)),\nwhere (TopK(ℓ))i := ℓi if ℓi is among the top-K coordinates of logits ℓ∈Rn and (TopK(ℓ))i := −∞\notherwise. The value of K – the number of experts used per token – is a hyper-parameter that modu-\nlates the amount of compute used to process each token. If one increases n while keeping K fixed, one\n1https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\n2\n\ncan increase the model’s parameter count while keeping its computational cost effectively constant.\nThis motivates a distinction between the model’s total parameter count (commonly referenced as the\nsparse parameter count), which grows with n, and the number of parameters used for processing an\nindividual token (called the active parameter count), which grows with K up to n.\nMoE layers can be run efficiently on single GPUs with high performance specialized kernels. For\nexample, Megablocks [13] casts the feed-forward network (FFN) operations of the MoE layer as large\nsparse matrix multiplications, significantly enhancing the execution speed and naturally handling\ncases where different experts get a variable number of tokens assigned to them. Moreover, the\nMoE layer can be distributed to multiple GPUs through standard Model Parallelism techniques, and\nthrough a particular kind of partitioning strategy called Expert Parallelism (EP) [28]. During the MoE\nlayer’s execution, tokens meant to be processed by a specific expert are routed to the corresponding\nGPU for processing, and the expert’s output is returned to the original token location. Note that EP\nintroduces challenges in load balancing, as it is essential to distribute the workload evenly across the\nGPUs to prevent overloading individual GPUs or hitting computational bottlenecks.\nIn a Transformer model, the MoE layer is applied independently per token and replaces the\nfeed-forward (FFN) sub-block of the transformer block. For Mixtral we use the same SwiGLU\narchitecture as the expert function Ei(x) and set K = 2. This means each token is routed to two\nSwiGLU sub-blocks with different sets of weights. Taking this all together, the output y for an input\ntoken x is computed as:\ny =\nn−1\nX\ni=0\nSoftmax(Top2(x · Wg))i · SwiGLUi(x).\nThis formulation is similar to the GShard architecture [21], with the exceptions that we replace all\nFFN sub-blocks by MoE layers while GShard replaces every other block, and that GShard uses a\nmore elaborate gating strategy for the second expert assigned to each token.\n3\nResults\nWe compare Mixtral to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair\ncomparison. We measure performance on a wide variety of tasks categorized as follow:\n• Commonsense Reasoning (0-shot): Hellaswag [32], Winogrande [26], PIQA [3], SIQA [27],\nOpenbookQA [22], ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge [8], CommonsenseQA [30]\n• World Knowledge (5-shot): NaturalQuestions [20], TriviaQA [19]\n• Reading Comprehension (0-shot): BoolQ [7], QuAC [5]\n• Math: GSM8K [9] (8-shot) with maj@8 and MATH [17] (4-shot) with maj@4\n• Code: Humaneval [4] (0-shot) and MBPP [1] (3-shot)\n• Popular aggregated results: MMLU [16] (5-shot), BBH [29] (3-shot), and AGI Eval [34]\n(3-5-shot, English multiple-choice questions only)\nFigure 2: Performance of Mixtral and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks.

Mixtral outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B performance on\nalmost all popular benchmarks while using 5x fewer active parameters during inference.\nFigure 3: Results on MMLU, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension,\nmath and code for Mistral (7B/8x7B) vs Llama 2 (7B/13B/70B). Mixtral largely outperforms Llama 2 70B\non all benchmarks, except on reading comprehension benchmarks while using 5x lower active parameters. It\nis also vastly superior to Llama 2 70B on code and math.\nDetailed results for Mixtral, Mistral 7B and Llama 2 7B/13B/70B and Llama 1 34B2 are reported\nin Table 2. Figure 2 compares the performance of Mixtral with the Llama models in different\ncategories. Mixtral surpasses Llama 2 70B across most metrics. In particular, Mixtral displays a\nsuperior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks.\nSize and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand\nMixtral models’ efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure 3). As a sparse Mixture-\nof-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active\nparameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories.\nNote that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section 2.1), which is directly\nproportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware\nutilization. The memory costs for serving Mixtral are proportional to its sparse parameter count,\n47B, which is still smaller than Llama 2 70B. As for device utilization, we note that the SMoEs layer\nintroduces additional overhead due to the routing mechanism and due to the increased memory loads\nwhen running more than one expert per device. They are more suitable for batched workloads where\none can reach a good degree of arithmetic intensity.\nComparison with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. In Table 3, we report the performance of Mixtral 8x7B\ncompared to Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. We observe that Mixtral performs similarly or above the\ntwo other models. On MMLU, Mixtral obtains a better performance, despite its significantly smaller\ncapacity (47B tokens compared to 70B). For MT Bench, we report the performance of the latest\nGPT-3.5-Turbo model available, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\n2Since Llama 2 34B was not open-sourced, we report results for Llama 1 34B.\n4\n\nLLaMA 2 70B\nGPT-3.5\nMixtral 8x7B\nMMLU\n(MCQ in 57 subjects)\n69.9%\n70.0%\n70.6%\nHellaSwag\n(10-shot)\n87.1%\n85.5%\n86.7%\nARC Challenge\n(25-shot)\n85.1%\n85.2%\n85.8%\nWinoGrande\n(5-shot)\n83.2%\n81.6%\n81.2%\nMBPP\n(pass@1)\n49.8%\n52.2%\n60.7%\nGSM-8K\n(5-shot)\n53.6%\n57.1%\n58.4%\nMT Bench\n(for Instruct Models)\n6.86\n8.32\n8.30\nTable 3: Comparison of Mixtral with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5.

The extra capacity allows Mixtral to perform well on multilingual benchmarks while\nmaintaining a high accuracy in English.

On ARC Challenge, Hellaswag,\nand MMLU, Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B on 4 languages: French, German, Spanish, and Italian.\n3.2\nLong range performance\nTo assess the capabilities of Mixtral to tackle long context, we evaluate it on the passkey retrieval\ntask introduced in [23], a synthetic task designed to measure the ability of the model to retrieve a\npasskey inserted randomly in a long prompt. Results in Figure 4 (Left) show that Mixtral achieves a\n100% retrieval accuracy regardless of the context length or the position of passkey in the sequence.\nFigure 4 (Right) shows that the perplexity of Mixtral on a subset of the proof-pile dataset [2] decreases\nmonotonically as the size of the context increases.\nFigure 4: Long range performance of Mixtral. (Left) Mixtral has 100% retrieval accuracy of the Passkey task\nregardless of the location of the passkey and length of the input sequence. (Right) The perplexity of Mixtral on\nthe proof-pile dataset decreases monotonically as the context length increases.\n5\n\n3.3\nBias Benchmarks\nLlama 2 70B\nMixtral 8x7B\nBBQ accuracy\n51.5%\n56.0%\nBOLD sentiment score (avg ± std)\ngender\n0.293 ± 0.073\n0.323 ±0.045\nprofession\n0.218 ± 0.073\n0.243 ± 0.087\nreligious_ideology\n0.188 ± 0.133\n0.144 ± 0.089\npolitical_ideology\n0.149 ± 0.140\n0.186 ± 0.146\nrace\n0.232 ± 0.049\n0.232 ± 0.052\nFigure 5: Bias Benchmarks. Compared Llama 2 70B,\nMixtral presents less bias (higher accuracy on BBQ, lower\nstd on BOLD) and displays more positive sentiment (higher\navg on BOLD).\nTo identify possible flaws to be corrected\nby fine-tuning / preference modeling, we\nmeasure the base model performance on\nBias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) [24] and\nBias in Open-Ended Language Generation\nDataset (BOLD) [10]. BBQ is a dataset\nof hand-written question sets that target\nattested social biases against nine differ-\nent socially-relevant categories: age, dis-\nability status, gender identity, nationality,\nphysical appearance, race/ethnicity, religion,\nsocio-economic status, sexual orientation.\nBOLD is a large-scale dataset that consists\nof 23,679 English text generation prompts\nfor bias benchmarking across five domains.\nWe benchmark Llama 2 and Mixtral on BBQ and BOLD with our evaluation framework and report\nthe results in Table 5. Compared to Llama 2, Mixtral presents less bias on the BBQ benchmark\n(56.0% vs 51.5%). For each group in BOLD, a higher average sentiment score means more positive\nsentiments and a lower standard deviation indicates less bias within the group. Overall, Mixtral\ndisplays more positive sentiments than Llama 2, with similar variances within each group.\n4\nInstruction Fine-tuning\nWe train Mixtral – Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an instruction dataset followed by\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) [25] on a paired feedback dataset. Mixtral – Instruct reaches a\nscore of 8.30 on MT-Bench [33] (see Table 2), making it the best open-weights model as of December\n2023. Independent human evaluation conducted by LMSys is reported in Figure 63 and shows that\nMixtral – Instruct outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Gemini Pro, Claude-2.1, and Llama 2 70B chat.\nFigure 6: LMSys Leaderboard. (Screenshot from Dec 22, 2023) Mixtral 8x7B Instruct v0.1 achieves an Arena\nElo rating of 1121 outperforming Claude-2.1 (1117), all versions of GPT-3.5-Turbo (1117 best), Gemini Pro\n(1111), and Llama-2-70b-chat (1077). Mixtral is currently the best open-weights model by a large margin.\n3https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard\n6\n\n5\nRouting analysis\nIn this section, we perform a small analysis on the expert selection by the router. In particular,\nwe are interested to see if during training some experts specialized to some specific domains (e.g.\nmathematics, biology, philosophy, etc.).\nTo investigate this, we measure the distribution of selected experts on different subsets of The Pile\nvalidation dataset [14]. Results are presented in Figure 7, for layers 0, 15, and 31 (layers 0 and 31\nrespectively being the first and the last layers of the model). Surprisingly, we do not observe obvious\npatterns in the assignment of experts based on the topic. For instance, at all layers, the distribution of\nexpert assignment is very similar for ArXiv papers (written in Latex), for biology (PubMed Abstracts),\nand for Philosophy (PhilPapers) documents.\nOnly for DM Mathematics we note a marginally different distribution of experts. This divergence is\nlikely a consequence of the dataset’s synthetic nature and its limited coverage of the natural language\nspectrum, and is particularly noticeable at the first and last layers, where the hidden states are very\ncorrelated to the input and output embeddings respectively.\nThis suggests that the router does exhibit some structured syntactic behavior. Figure 8 shows\nexamples of text from different domains (Python code, mathematics, and English), where each token\nis highlighted with a background color corresponding to its selected expert. The figure shows that\nwords such as ‘self’ in Python and ‘Question’ in English often get routed through the same expert\neven though they involve multiple tokens. Similarly, in code, the indentation tokens are always\nassigned to the same experts, particularly at the first and last layers where the hidden states are more\ncorrelated to the input and output of the model.\nWe also note from Figure 8 that consecutive tokens are often assigned the same experts. In fact, we\nobserve some degree of positional locality in The Pile datasets. Table 5 shows the proportion of con-\nsecutive tokens that get the same expert assignments per domain and layer.

We evaluate the proportion of times the same expert is\nassigned to a token i and its following token i+1. We report whether the first chosen expert is the same, or whether\nthe same expert is observed as first or second choice in consecutive tokens. For reference, the expected proportion\nof repetitions in the case of random assignments is 1\n8 = 12.5% for “First choice” and 1 −6\n8\n5\n7 ≈46% for “First\nand second choice”. Repetitions at the first layer are close to random, but are significantly higher at layers 15\nand 31. The high number of repetitions shows that expert choice exhibits high temporal locality at these layers.\nconsecutive assignments is significantly higher than random for higher layers. This has implications\nin how one might optimize the model for fast training and inference. For example, cases with high\nlocality are more likely to cause over-subscription of certain experts when doing Expert Parallelism.\nConversely, this locality can be leveraged for caching, as is done in [11]. A more complete view of\nthese same expert frequency is provided for all layers and across datasets in Figure 10 in the Appendix.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced Mixtral 8x7B, the first mixture-of-experts network to reach a state-of-the-\nart performance among open-source models. Mixtral 8x7B Instruct outperforms Claude-2.1, Gem-\nini Pro, and GPT-3.5 Turbo on human evaluation benchmarks. Because it only uses two experts at each\ntime step, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters per token while outperforming the previous best\nmodel using 70B parameters per token (Llama 2 70B). We are making our trained and fine-tuned mod-\nels publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license. By sharing our models, we aim to facilitate the de-\nvelopment of new techniques and applications that can benefit a wide range of industries and domains.\nFigure 8: Text samples where each token is colored with the first expert choice. The selection of experts\nappears to be more aligned with the syntax rather than the domain, especially at the initial and final layers.\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the CoreWeave and Scaleway teams for technical support as we trained our models.
