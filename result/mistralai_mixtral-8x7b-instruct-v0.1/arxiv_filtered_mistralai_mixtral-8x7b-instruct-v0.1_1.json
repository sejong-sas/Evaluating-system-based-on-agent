{
  "1-1 (Weights)": "The provided material repeatedly emphasizes that the model weights for the target system, “Mixtral 8x7B” and its instruction-tuned variant “Mixtral 8x7B – Instruct,” are openly released. One quote states: “In this paper, we present Mixtral 8x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0.” Another adds: “We release both Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x7B – Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license…, free for academic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility….” From these lines we can summarize that (a) the weights are publicly downloadable, (b) they are covered by the permissive Apache 2.0 license, and (c) the release explicitly targets broad, unrestricted academic and commercial use. No concrete URL, hosting platform, or authentication procedure is given in the quotes, but the language “open weights” and “we release” signals that anyone can obtain them under the stated license terms.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "Two sentences mention code availability. First: “Code: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src,” following a description of Mixtral 8x7B – Instruct, indicates that a public GitHub repository exists. Second: “To enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to the vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference.” Together these lines show (1) at least some project code is released, (2) the GitHub repo is the central location, and (3) additional contributions were merged into the open-source vLLM inference engine. The quotes speak only about running or inference-time optimizations; they do not explicitly claim that full pre-training or fine-tuning scripts, data-prep pipelines, or RL schedules are included. Hence, the evidence supports public release of inference/serving code and related optimizations, but does not confirm that the complete training pipeline is open.",
  "1-3 (License)": "Every licensing statement in the quotes references Apache 2.0. Examples include: “open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0,” “Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license,” and “under the Apache 2.0 license…, free for academic and commercial usage.” Apache 2.0 is a highly permissive open-source license granting (a) use, (b) modification, (c) redistribution, and (d) commercial exploitation, provided that copyright and license notices are retained and patent terms are observed. The phrase “free for academic and commercial usage” reinforces that no additional restrictions (such as non-commercial or research-only clauses) are imposed. No statements in the supplied material limit derivatives, forbid redistribution, or constrain commercial deployment, so the standard Apache 2.0 rights apply.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "The only bibliographic pointer given is: “Webpage: https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/.” This link appears to be the official blog post or technical report corresponding to Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x7B – Instruct. No formal conference paper, arXiv preprint, or DOI is cited in the provided sentences, but the webpage presumably functions as the primary technical description accompanying the model release.",
