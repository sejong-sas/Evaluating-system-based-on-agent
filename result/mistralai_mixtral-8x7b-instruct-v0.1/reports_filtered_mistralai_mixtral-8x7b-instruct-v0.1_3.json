  "2-3 (API)": "The quotes present Mixtral 8x7B v0.1 in a “Legacy models” table that explicitly lists API support. Both entries show a check-mark under “API Endpoints,” identifying the public endpoint name as “open-mixtral-8x7b.” The same row confirms that the model weights are downloadable under the Apache-2.0 license (check-mark in “Model Weight availability”). Versioning information is precise—v0.1—and the lifecycle is spelled out: a deprecation date of 2024-11-30 followed by a retirement date of 2025-03-30. The table also recommends an alternative endpoint (“mistral-small-latest”) once the legacy model is phased out. In short, Mixtral 8x7B v0.1 is exposed through official, documented API endpoints, with clear versioning, licensing, availability of weights, and published sunset timelines.",
