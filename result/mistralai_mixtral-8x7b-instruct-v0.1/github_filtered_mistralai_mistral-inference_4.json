  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "The only available quote is a single reference to Mistral’s guardrailing documentation: “Guardrailing: https://docs.mistral.ai/usage/guardrailing.”  This citation indicates that the model’s data-filtering or safety pipeline is addressed under a dedicated “guardrailing” section of Mistral’s official usage guide.  However, the quote itself provides no concrete filtering criteria, numeric thresholds, classifier names, or stage-by-stage descriptions.  It merely signals that such information—presumably covering the mechanisms used to detect and mitigate unsafe or low-quality content—exists in the linked documentation, but those details are not included in the excerpt supplied here.",
