Four best practices can reduce ML training energy by up to 100x and CO2\nemissions up to 1000x. By following best practices, overall ML energy use (across research,\ndevelopment, and production) held steady at <15% of Google’s total energy use for the past three years.\nIf the whole ML field were to adopt best practices, total carbon emissions from training would reduce.\nHence, we recommend that ML papers include emissions explicitly to foster competition on more than\njust model quality. Estimates of emissions in papers that omitted them have been off 100x–100,000x, so\npublishing emissions has the added benefit of ensuring accurate accounting. Given the importance of\nclimate change, we must get the numbers right to make certain that we work on its biggest challenges.\nKeywords/Index terms: I.2.6.g Machine learning < I.2.6 Learning < I.2 Artificial Intelligence\n< I Computing Methodologies, I.2.7 Natural Language Processing < I.2 Artificial Intelligence\n< I Computing Methodologies, B.9 Power Management < B Hardware, C.1.3.i Neural nets\n< C.1.3 Other Architecture Styles < C.1 Processor Architectures < C Computer Systems Organization,\nC.4 Performance of Systems < C Computer Systems Organization\n1. Introduction\nOver the past few years, a growing number of papers have highlighted the carbon emissions of machine\nlearning (ML) workloads. While this work has been instrumental in rightfully elevating the discussion\naround carbon emissions in ML, some studies significantly overestimated actual emissions, which in turn\nled to worrisome extrapolations [1,2]:\nThe answers are grim: Training such a model would cost US$100 billion and would produce as\nmuch carbon emissions as New York City does in a month.\nRecent work highlights the complexities and nuances associated with carbon accounting for ML and\nmore broadly computing workloads [3, 4, 5]. In this paper, we\n●\nDescribe four practices that reduce the energy usage and carbon emissions of ML workloads by\norders of magnitude relative to traditional choices;\n●\nShow that these practices help keep ML under 15% of Google’s total energy use for the past\nthree years; and\n●\nExplain why published faulty estimates and extrapolations are 100x–100,000x higher than the\nreal carbon footprints.\nResponsible AI is a broad topic; we focus on a single issue that has received much attention from the\nML community and public: carbon emissions from ML training. Emissions can be classified as\n●\nOperational, the energy cost of operating the ML hardware including datacenter overheads, or\n●\nLifecycle, which additionally includes the embedded carbon emitted during the manufacturing of\nall components involved, from chips to datacenter buildings.\nLike prior work we focus on operational emissions; estimating lifecycle emissions is a larger, future study.\nWe identified best practices that can reduce energy by up to 100x and carbon emissions by up to\n1000x compared to following orthodox choices (“4Ms”):\n2 University of California, Berkeley\n1 Google\n1\n\n1.\nModel. Selecting efficient ML model architectures while advancing ML quality, such as sparse\nmodels versus dense modes, can reduce computation by factors of ~5–10.\n2.\nMachine. Using processors optimized for ML training such as TPUs or recent GPUs (e.g., V100\nor A100), versus general-purpose processors, can improve performance/Watt by factors of 2–5.\n3.\nMechanization. Computing in the Cloud rather than on premise improves datacenter energy\nefficiency3, reducing energy costs by a factor of 1.4–2.\n4.\nMap. Moreover, Cloud computing lets ML practitioners pick the location with the cleanest energy4,\nfurther reducing the gross carbon footprint by factors of 5–105.\nFigure 1. Reduction in gross CO2 emissions since 2017 from applying best practices (Section 3).\nThey show large end-to-end improvements, broken down into the 4Ms. Gross CO2 emissions here\nexcludes Google's carbon neutral and 100% renewable energy credits, and reflect Google's 24/7\nCFE methodology [5].\nFigure 1 illustrates how four good choices together reduce energy consumption by 83x and CO2\nemissions by 747x over four years while maintaining the same quality. The original modeled estimate\n5 Using a carbon-neutral cloud like Facebook or Google further reduces the footprint to zero because they match\n100% of operational energy use with renewable energy. We exclude those offsets.\n4 Most data transmission power is for the network equipment of the Internet even when idle [3]. In comparison,\nshipping photons over fiber optics is relatively trivial.\n3 The Cloud uses custom warehouses designed for energy efficiency, whereas on-premise datacenters are\ninefficiently located in smaller, older spaces intended for other purposes. HPC datacenters are efficient, but can’t\nenable shifting to green locations.\n2\n\nrepresents training the Transformer model in 2017 on an ML-oblivious GPU6 in an average datacenter\nusing an average energy mix (like [2]). The yellow line shows optimizations possible in 2019, the green\nline optimizations possible today. In both cases, optimized ML hardware reduces energy consumption\nsignificantly, with newest-generation hardware (TPUv4) providing an additional 2.4x over the 2019\nhardware (TPUv2). Using efficient cloud datacenters and a low-carbon datacenter region per Google’s\n24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) methodology further reduces the carbon footprint by another order of\nmagnitude (note the log-scale Y axis), resulting in a 747-fold reduction in carbon footprint compared to\nthe original estimate. In this paper, gross CO2 emissions are the carbon emissions resulting from a\nworkload in a particular location before any compensating actions.\nSupported by the results in Figure 1 and in Section 3, we predict that if ML communities embrace\nthese best practices, the carbon footprint of ML training will shrink over this decade.\nBelow we summarize this paper’s contributions:\n●\nTwo studies show the impact of best practices: a 750x emissions reduction without loss of\naccuracy from Transformer (Figure 1) and a 14x emissions reduction from GPT-3 by the larger\nGLaM model that improves accuracy.\n●\nLocation choice, even within one country, can significantly impact the carbon footprint.\n●\nWe provide the first report by a hyperscaler company of the percentage of its overall energy use\ndevoted to ML training and inference.\n●\nWe show that the carbon footprint of searching for better ML models can reduce the impact of\ndownstream ML tasks by much more than the cost of the search.\n●\nWe describe how following best practices significantly reduced the energy consumption and\ncarbon footprint of training compared to the faulty estimates commonly cited [2,6,7].\n2. Overview of Energy and CO2e for ML Training\nWe estimate energy and carbon footprints using these terms:\n●\nCO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) accounts for carbon dioxide (CO2) and all the other greenhouse\ngasses as well: methane, nitrous oxide, and so on.\n●\nMetric tons are the common CO2e unit of measure, abbreviated as tCO2e, representing 1000\nkilograms (2205 pounds).\n●\nMegawatt hours (MWh) measure energy; one MWh equals 1,000,000 Watts of electricity used\ncontinuously for 1 hour. One Terawatt hour (TWh) equals 1,000,000 MWh.\n●\nPower Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is the industry standard metric of datacenter efficiency, defined\nas the ratio between total energy usage (including all overheads, like cooling) divided by the\nenergy directly consumed by the datacenter’s computing equipment. The average industry\ndatacenter PUE in 2020 was 1.58 (58% overhead) while cloud providers have PUEs of ~1.10 [5].\n●\nCarbon intensity (tCO2e per MWh) is a measure of the cleanliness of a datacenter’s energy. The\naverage datacenter carbon emissions in 2020 was 0.429 tCO2e per MWh but the gross CO2e per\nMWh can be 5x lower in some Google datacenters.\n6 The 2016 NVIDIA P100 was optimized for graphics, not ML.\n3\n\nThe energy consumption of the servers performing a training task is proportional to the number of\nprocessors used and the duration of the training run:\n𝑀𝑊ℎ= 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 × 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑠× 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑟\nWe include all server components in “Processor” (including local memory, network links, and so on).\nAdditionally, the datacenter consumes energy to power and cool the hardware (e.g., voltage\ntransformation losses, cooling equipment), captured by PUE. Thus, the final formula for energy\nconsumption:\n𝑀𝑊ℎ= (𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 × 𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑠× 𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑟) × 𝑃𝑈𝐸\nWe can then turn energy into carbon by multiplying it with the carbon intensity of the energy supply:\n𝑡𝐶𝑂2𝑒= 𝑀𝑊ℎ× 𝑡 𝐶𝑂2𝑒 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑀𝑊ℎ\nThe real-world values for many factors are readily available. ML practitioners usually publish the number\nand type of processors and hours to train, and the power consumption of most hardware components is\nwell known or can be measured accurately. Many Cloud companies publish the PUE of their datacenters.\nIn comparison, carbon intensity is harder to obtain. For this paper we use the carbon intensity of\nGoogle datacenters, derived from Figure 2. We hope other providers will publish so that carbon intensity\ncan be compared across datacenters.\nFigure 2. Percent Carbon Free Energy by Google Cloud Location in 2020. The map shows the\n%CFE and how the percentage changes by time of day. Chile has a high %CFE from 6AM to 8PM,\nbut not at night. The US examples on this map range from 19% CFE in Nevada to 93% in Iowa,\nwhich has strong prevailing winds both night and day. (sustainability.google/progress/energy/)\n4\n\n3. Case Study 1: Transformer vs. Evolved Transformer vs. Primer\nMany of the headline grabbing advances in AI stem from deep neural networks (DNNs); indeed, three\nDNN leaders shared the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award.\nDNN computations have two phases: training, which constructs accurate models through an\nintensive computational process involving iterative updating of parameters, and inference, which uses\nthe trained models to generate outputs from model inputs. ML practitioners use different models for\ndifferent tasks: object recognition, language translation, and so on. Training “learns” parameters that\nraise the likelihood of correctly mapping from input to result. Unlike in traditional computing, the actual\nDNN code is relatively small. The “smarts” come from training DNNs from millions of labeled examples\nversus writing millions of lines of code.\nThe Transformer model debuted in 2017 and is used primarily for natural language processing (NLP).\nIts distinguishing feature is focusing attention on portions of its input. Two years later, So et al used\nneural architecture search (NAS) to discover the Evolved Transformer model that matched Transformer’s\nquality scores but was ~1.3x faster [8]. In 2021, a different NAS found the Primer model that again\nmatched the quality scores but was 4.2x faster than the original Transformer [9].\nFigure 1 above plots the end-to-end reduction in CO2e by applying the best practices from Section 1.\nThe reference point is the Transformer model trained on a P100 GPU in an average on-premise\ndatacenter with the average PUE of 1.60 in 2017 and using the average tCO2e per MWh of 0.488. Here\nare the practices (4Ms):\n1.\nModel. In 2019 the best model was Evolved Transformer, in 2021 Primer.\n2.\nMachine. Compared to the unoptimized P100s from 2017, the ML-optimized TPUv2 in 2019 and\nTPUv4 in 2021 reduce energy consumption by 5.7x and 13.7x, respectively. This reduction is a\nfunction of both improved logic (more specialized hardware), newer chip fabrication technology,\nand more efficient mapping of the training task to hardware (better utilization of the functional\nunits) [10].\n3.\nMechanization. The third point shows a reduction of 1.4x from the better PUE of Google’s Cloud\ndatacenter versus the average datacenter.\n4.\nMap. A big surprise was how much location of the datacenter affected carbon intensity (Figure 2).\nIn 2019, the datacenter in the US region with the highest CFE score was Oklahoma with a score\nof 96%, and in 2020 it was Iowa at 93%.\nTo summarize, following best practices yields a 65x reduction in CO2e two years after Transformer\nwas introduced. Two additional years later—with ML model, hardware, and energy mix\nimprovements—another 11x was possible, for an overall reduction of 747x. These drastic overall\nimprovements, as well as their trajectory over time, suggest that extrapolating current parameters to\npredict future CO2e is fraught with peril.\n4. Case Study 2: GPT-3 vs GLaM\nNext is a large NLP model that received considerable attention in the ML community and in the press in\n2020: GPT-3 is an autoregressive language model with 175B parameters, 10x more than any non-sparse\nlanguage model at the time, and 100-1000x more than most other ML models [11]. To put GPT-3 into\nperspective, its predecessor GPT-2 had 1.5B parameters, and the Transformer models above used\n≤0.2B. Developed by OpenAI, GPT-3 was trained on 10,000 V100 GPUs7 in a Microsoft cloud\ndatacenter.\n7 The 2017 NVIDIA V100 is optimized for ML.\n5\n\nA winner of the best paper award at NeurIPS, the recent GPT-3 paper already has >2500 citations\nand made mainstream media headlines. One benefit of large models like GPT-3 is that they don’t need to\nbe retrained for every new task—called few-shot generalization—unlike smaller models.\nGLaM is a new language model using 7x more parameters than GPT-3. It is a mixture of experts\nmodel that only activates experts selectively based on the input so that no more than 95B parameters\n(8%) are active per input token. The dense GPT-3 activates all 175B parameters on every token. More\nparameters and sparsity allow GLaM to exceed GPT-3 on quality and efficiency [12].\nFigure 3 compares them. GPT-3 took 405 V100 years to train in 2020. OpenAI trained in the\nMicrosoft cloud to leverage a low PUE but with an energy mix that matched the US datacenter average\n[5]. In comparison, GLaM trained on TPUv4s in 2.8x fewer accelerator years, using 2.8x less energy than\nGPT-3. Additionally, GLaM ran in the Oklahoma datacenter where the tCO2e per MWh was ~5x lower\n(0.088 vs 0.429). Evolved Transformer and Primer improve energy use and CO2e while maintaining\nquality scores, but GLaM improves all three metrics.\nML researchers are continuously improving the efficiency of large language models through\ninnovations in algorithms and model architectures. Only 18 months after GPT-3, GLaM can reduce the\ngross carbon footprint by ~14x despite raising accuracy. These drastic improvements again show that\nextrapolating current ML trends to predict future ML energy use and CO2e can greatly overestimate\nconsumption, as there are continuous, significant improvements in algorithms and hardware.\nFigure 3. Parameters, accelerator years of computation, energy consumption, and gross CO2e for\nGPT-3 and GLaM. If instead of outperforming GPT-3 on quality scores, GLaM was only trained to\nmatch, it would halve the time, energy, and CO2e. Google's renewable energy purchases further\nreduce the impact to zero.\n5. Overall ML Energy Consumption\nThe previous sections investigate the energy consumption of a single training task. Here we discuss the\noverall footprint of all ML workloads at a major user of ML, Google.\nMany hyperscalers regularly publish their energy consumption metrics. According to their\nsustainability reports, the annual energy consumption in 2020 was 15.4 TWh for Google and 10.8 TWh\nfor Microsoft. These reports put the training energy of large models into perspective. Training GPT-3 was\n~0.012% of Microsoft’s energy consumption in 2020 and GlaM was ~0.004% of Google’s. For further\ncomparison, the portion of the 22,000 people from 68 countries who in 2019 flew to attend the two major\nML conferences (NeurIPS and CVPR) collectively had a CO2e impact arguably had ~10x–100x higher\nthan the impact of training of all the ML models in this paper [5].\n6\n\nWhile Google’s overall energy consumption increases as usage grows, our data shows that despite\nthe growth of ML applications, the ML portion of Google’s overall energy consumption is not increasing.\nTo estimate that fraction, we measured the energy consumption (including datacenter overheads) of the\nfollowing components:\n●\nAll TPUs and GPUs in Google datacenters, including associated dedicated servers and\nnetworking equipment. Virtually all ML training executes on TPUs and GPUs and most inference\nas well. We can differentiate training versus inference runs on TPUs and GPUs.\n●\nAny CPU consumption attributable to ML inference (no significant training was done solely on\nCPUs).\nTo estimate the CPU portion of inference, we inspected Google-Wide Profiling results to measure CPU\nconsumption of the libraries used for ML inference. We then converted CPU utilization into energy\nconsumption using sensors that measure server power. Our numbers likely overestimate because some\nlibraries are used in non-ML cases as well. Also, we may double count some host CPUs already\naccounted for in the TPU/GPU measurements, and some GPU use is for graphics.\nWe retroactively performed these calculations based on data for one week of April in 2019, 2020, and\n2021. Each time the ML portion was 10% to 15% of Google's total energy consumption for that week\ndespite ML representing 70%-80% of the FLOPS at Google8. While ML usage certainly increased during\nthese three years, algorithmic and hardware improvements kept that growth to a rate comparable with\noverall energy growth at Google. Across all three years, about ⅗ of ML energy use is for inference and ⅖\nfor training. These measurements include all ML energy usage: research, development, testing, and\nproduction.\nConsequently, we take the stable fraction for ML as a strong indication that despite ML’s increasing\npopularity, if we follow best practices its energy consumption is not skyrocketing, contrary to commonly\nexpressed fears. This stability may reflect economic factors in addition to technical factors: after all,\neverything has a budget, and budget limits encourage efficient use of ML resources.\nWorldwide datacenter energy consumption is not growing quickly either. [4] observes that global\ndatacenter energy consumption increased by only 6% from 2010 to 2018, despite datacenter computing\ncapacity increasing by 550% over the same time period, and contrary to 2010 predictions of a 70%\nincrease by 2018. One key factor was the shift from conventional datacenters to cloud datacenters. Not\nonly are cloud datacenters often more efficient, cloud servers typically have significantly higher utilization\nthan on-premise servers. That allows the same workloads to be served with less hardware and thus less\nenergy, just as books purchased for libraries are more frequently read than books purchased for home\nuse. As of 2021 only 15%-20% of all workloads have moved to the Cloud [13], so there is still plenty of\nheadroom for Cloud growth to replace inefficient on-premise datacenters.\nFinally, most cloud companies compensate at least partially for their carbon emissions. In particular,\nGoogle (since 2017) and Facebook (since 2020) purchase enough renewable energy annually to match\n100% of their usage, so each MWh of new consumption is offset by one MWh of new renewable energy,\nalbeit not necessarily in the same location. Microsoft’s similar goal is for 2025. Thus, the net carbon\nimpact of ML computations for some companies could be considered zero. Such multi-billion dollar direct\nenergy purchases by hyperscalers have spurred the growth of renewable energy substantially: in some\ncountries, they are more significant investors in renewable energy than government subsidies [14].\n6. Additional Factors\nFor completeness, we will briefly address two other concerns about ML energy usage: the impact of\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS), which may run thousands of training runs as part of a single\n8 See Section 7 for an explanation why using many more FLOPS does not imply using much more energy.\n7\n\nsearch—potentially exploding overall energy consumption—and ML’s impact on client-side energy\nusage.\nA commonly expressed concern is that automated methods might increase training energy\nconsumption. As the name implies, NAS uses computers to find models with higher quality or efficiency\nthan human experts can find. NAS is generally not performed once per model training, but once per\nproblem domain+architectural search space combination. Evolved Transformer and Primer are examples\nof the benefits of NAS [8, 9]. NAS has also been applied to find models that have better quality and run\nfaster by adapting them to a given processor [15].\nThe NAS producing Evolved Transformer used 7.5 MWh. The use of Evolved Transformer while\ntraining the large Meena model saved 15x the energy cost of this NAS [5]. Finding the even faster Primer\nused only 6.2 MWh. Overall, NAS is a net environmental gain if the discovered model is trained more\nthan a few times. Often, the more efficient models found by NAS are open-sourced and reused hundreds\nor even thousands of times [5]. Consequently, as a whole, it is likely that NAS reduces total ML energy\nusage by producing more efficient models whose downstream use more than compensates for the initial\nsearch effort.\nTo estimate ML energy use on client devices, [16] studied mobile phones. Most modern phones have\nML accelerators; for example, the Google Pixel 6 phone has an Edge TPU, which runs most of the ML\nworkload. During a typical day, the Edge TPU consumes less than 1% of the phone’s energy. Client use\nof ML libraries and ML applications (bar code reading, OCR, face recognition, etc) played a similar minor\nrole. CPU and GPU account for ~8% of total energy usage on phones, of which a small fraction is for ML.\nTo be on the safe side, we use a generous upper bound for ML energy usage on today’s mobile phones\nof 5%.\nThe estimated global energy use of the 3.8B mobile phones in 2021 is ~7.9 TWh, assuming nightly\ncharging and accounting for charger inefficiency [16]. The upper bound for ML on mobile phones is then\n0.4 TWh. Google’s ML server energy use in 2020 was ~6 times higher than this conservative estimate of\nML on all mobile phones. This calculation does not include the other energy consumption of ML at other\ncloud companies, so server-side ML energy usage clearly dominates client-side usage.\n7. Related Work\n[17] is a similar study that also provides a framework to understand the potential climate impacts of ML\nresearch. It also offers a leaderboard to foster competitions on reducing CO2e of ML and a tool to collect\nenergy use and CO2e from the preliminary training runs. [5] is a 22-page technical report by the authors\nof this paper that goes into greater detail on the many of the issues here.\n[18] warns of the danger of “Red AI”, which focuses on model quality gains regardless of the training\ncost or CO2e. They encourage embracing “Green AI” where the focus is on computing efficiency as well\nas model quality. Arguing that it can be difficult to measure energy and CO2e, they recommend\nminimizing the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) to train a model. Alas, FLOPs is not a good\nmetric, for time and energy can be uncorrelated with FLOPs. For example, AutoML found faster models\nthat used 2.4x as many FLOPs [15]. An underlying reason is that main memory accesses are much\nslower and use much more energy than FLOPs today. A DRAM access is ~6000x energy of a 16b FLOP\n(1300 vs 0.21 picoJoules) [10]. Another reason is that scaling up FLOPS/sec is much easier for ML\naccelerators than scaling up memory bandwidth9. To improve efficiency further, ML practitioners should\nfocus more on reducing memory accesses than on FLOPs. More successful attempts to simplify\ncalculation of energy are online calculators, such as the ML Emissions Calculator [5,19].\n9 These ratios and the ease for hardware to scale up FLOPS/second also helps explain how ML energy use can be\nunder 15% despite ML being responsible for 70%–80% of the FLOPS over the past three years.\n8\n\nThe opening quote in Section 1 is based on a 2019 study from the University of Massachusetts\n(UMass) that estimated the environmental impact of training [2]. More than 1000 papers cite this paper\nas the source for the impact on carbon emissions of ML models, e.g., [1,6,7,17,18,19,20]. The study\ncalculated the energy consumed and carbon footprint of the NAS by [8] that led to Evolved Transformer.\nThe UMass estimate was 284 tCO2e for NAS; the actual number was only 3.2 tCO2e, a factor of 88\nsmaller. The reasons for the overshoot:\n1.\nSince the authors of the original NAS paper didn’t include energy and emissions for Google\nsystems, the UMass estimate was based on older GPUs not optimized for ML10 instead of TPUv2\nand on the average datacenter PUE and average carbon intensity instead of the real numbers for\na Google datacenter. This difference explains 5x.\n2.\nThere was also confusion about the computational cost of NAS. Described subtly in [8], the\nEvolved Transformer NAS used a small proxy task to search for the best models to save time,\nmoney, and energy, and then scaled up the found models to full size. However, [2] assumed the\nsearch was done with full size tasks. The resulting computation estimate for NAS was another\n18.7x too high\nThe actual overshoot was 18.7x for computation and 5x for Google versus the average datacenter, so\nthe real emissions for the one-time search were 88x less (3.2 versus 284 tCO2e).\nThe faulty estimates in [2] are understandable given the lack of access to internal information. It is\nlikewise understandable that those estimates were propagated in other papers, like [1,6,7,17,18,19,20].\nUnfortunately, some papers that cite this work confused the one-time cost of the NAS of [8] with the\nrelatively tiny “every-time” cost that is incurred from training. This cost difference is more than 1000x11.\nThis confusion led them to believe Evolved Transformer used more than 2 million GPU hours to train,\ncost millions of dollars, and its emissions were five times the lifetime of a car (284,019 kg) [6,7]. In reality,\ntraining the medium Evolved Transformer, which achieves the same accuracy level as the\nTransformer-big model,   takes 120 TPUv2 hours, costs $40, and emits only 2.4 kg (0.00004 car\nlifetimes), 120,000x less. This gap is nearly as large as if one overestimated the CO2e to manufacture a\ncar by 100x and then used that number as the CO2e for driving a car.12\nAccuracy is difficult if estimated retrospectively, as evidenced by the difference between these\npublished estimates and actual measurements. This example underlines the importance of our\nrecommendation that authors calculate and publish energy consumption and carbon footprint.\n8.\nConclusion\nMachine Learning (ML) workloads have rapidly grown in importance, raising legitimate concerns about\ntheir energy usage. Fortunately, the real-world energy usage trend of ML is fairly boring. While overall\nenergy use at Google grows annually with greater usage, the percentage for ML has held steady for the\npast three years, representing <15% of total energy usage. Inference represents about ⅗ of total ML\nenergy usage at Google, owing to the many billion-user services that use ML. GLaM, the largest natural\nlanguage model trained in 2021, improved model quality yet produced 14x less CO2e than training the\nprevious state-of-the art model from 2020 (GPT-3) and used only 0.004% of Google’s annual energy.\nFurthermore, we illustrated that in large scale production ML deployments, minimizing emissions from\ntraining is not the ultimate goal. Instead, the combined emissions of training and serving need to be\nminimized. Approaches like neural architecture search increase emissions but lead to more efficient\nserving and a strong overall reduction of the carbon footprint of ML. Another perspective is that some\n12 The average US car trip produces 4 kg, but manufacturing a car generates 9200 kg of CO2e (2300x more).\n11 The NASs for Evolved Transformer and Primer produce 1347x and 1618x more CO2e, respectively, than their\ntraining.\n10 They used the P100. The most recent GPU available was the V100, which is much faster in part because it was\noptimized for ML, unlike the P100.\n9\n\nconsider the carbon footprint to be erased entirely if the cloud provider matches 100% of their energy\nconsumption with renewable energy, as Google and Facebook have done and as Microsoft will soon do.\nWhile ML workloads have grown rapidly over the past decade, and while the number of computations\nper training run has similarly increased by orders of magnitude, our data shows that technology\nimprovements have largely compensated for this increased load. We believe this consistent overall low\npercentage is a testimony to the benefits of following best practices:\n●\nDatacenter providers should publish the PUE, %CFE, and CO2e/MWh per location so that\ncustomers who care can understand and reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint.\n●\nML practitioners should train using the most effective processors in the greenest datacenter that\nthey have access to, which today is often in the Cloud.\n●\nML researchers should continue to develop more efficient ML models [8,9], such as by leveraging\nsparsity [12] or by integrating retrieval into a smaller model. They should also publish their energy\nconsumption and carbon footprint, both in order to foster competition on more than just model\nquality and to ensure accurate accounting of their work, which is difficult to do accurately\npost-hoc.\nThese numbers may vary across companies, but the practices we’ve identified are applicable to virtually\nall ML training workloads and open to all to use. As a result, we predict that if all ML communities\nembrace these best practices, we can create a virtuous circle that will bend the curve so that in this\ndecade we’ll see the total carbon footprint of ML training at first plateau and then shrink.\nFinally, we show that published studies overestimated the cost and carbon footprint of ML training\nbecause they didn’t have access to the right information or because they extrapolated point-in-time data\nwithout accounting for algorithmic or hardware improvements.\nClimate change is important, so we must get the numbers right to ensure that we work on the biggest\nchallenges. Many efforts are underway to reduce the operational energy and CO2e of ML training, as\nillustrated by the 4Ms: model, machine, mechanization, and map. Thus, within information technology, we\nbelieve the biggest climate change challenge is not the operational cost of ML but more likely the\nlifecycle cost of manufacturing computing equipment of all types and sizes13.\nAcknowledgement.

      "full_text": "The Llama 3 Herd of Models\nLlama Team, AI @ Meta1\n1A detailed contributor list can be found in the appendix of this paper.\nModern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a\nnew set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support\nmultilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with\n405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive\nempirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language\nmodels such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and\npost-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input\nand output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image,\nvideo, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach\nperforms competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The\nresulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.\nDate: July 23, 2024\nWebsite: https://llama.meta.com/\n1\nIntroduction\nFoundation models are general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are designed\nto support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: (1) a pre-training stage in which\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\nand (2) a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called Llama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the results presented in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models,\nwhich we will refer to as Llama 3 throughout for brevity.\nWe believe there are three key levers in the development of high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and\nmanaging complexity. We seek to optimize for these three levers in our development process:\n• Data. Compared to prior versions of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), we improved both the quantity and\nquality of the data we use for pre-training and post-training. These improvements include the development\nof more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data and the development of more\nrigorous quality assurance and filtering approaches for post-training data. We pre-train Llama 3 on a\ncorpus of about 15T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8T tokens for Llama 2.\n• Scale. We train a model at far larger scale than previous Llama models: our flagship language model was\npre-trained using 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs, almost 50× more than the largest version of Llama 2. Specifically,\nwe pre-trained a flagship model with 405B trainable parameters on 15.6T text tokens. As expected per\n1\narXiv:2407.21783v3  [cs.AI]  23 Nov 2024\n\nFinetuned\nMultilingual\nLong context\nTool use\nRelease\nLlama 3 8B\n✗\n✗1\n✗\n✗\nApril 2024\nLlama 3 8B Instruct\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✗\nApril 2024\nLlama 3 70B\n✗\n✗1\n✗\n✗\nApril 2024\nLlama 3 70B Instruct\n✓\n✗\n✗\n✗\nApril 2024\nLlama 3.1 8B\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\nJuly 2024\nLlama 3.1 8B Instruct\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nJuly 2024\nLlama 3.1 70B\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\nJuly 2024\nLlama 3.1 70B Instruct\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nJuly 2024\nLlama 3.1 405B\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\nJuly 2024\nLlama 3.1 405B Instruct\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nJuly 2024\nTable 1 Overview of the Llama 3 Herd of models. All results in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models.\nscaling laws for foundation models, our flagship model outperforms smaller models trained using the\nsame procedure. While our scaling laws suggest our flagship model is an approximately compute-optimal\nsize for our training budget, we also train our smaller models for much longer than is compute-optimal.\nThe resulting models perform better than compute-optimal models at the same inference budget. We\nuse the flagship model to further improve the quality of those smaller models during post-training.\n• Managing complexity. We make design choices that seek to maximize our ability to scale the model\ndevelopment process. For example, we opt for a standard dense Transformer model architecture (Vaswani\net al., 2017) with minor adaptations, rather than for a mixture-of-experts model (Shazeer et al., 2017)\nto maximize training stability. Similarly, we adopt a relatively simple post-training procedure based\non supervised finetuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO;\nRafailov et al. (2023)) as opposed to more complex reinforcement learning algorithms (Ouyang et al.,\n2022; Schulman et al., 2017) that tend to be less stable and harder to scale.\nThe result of our work is Llama 3: a herd of three multilingual1 language models with 8B, 70B, and 405B\nparameters. We evaluate the performance of Llama 3 on a plethora of benchmark datasets that span a wide\nrange of language understanding tasks. In addition, we perform extensive human evaluations that compare\nLlama 3 with competing models. An overview of the performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on key\nbenchmarks is presented in Table 2. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our flagship model performs\non par with leading language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) across a variety of tasks, and is close to\nmatching the state-of-the-art. Our smaller models are best-in-class, outperforming alternative models with\nsimilar numbers of parameters (Bai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Llama 3 also delivers a much better\nbalance between helpfulness and harmlessness than its predecessor (Touvron et al., 2023b). We present a\ndetailed analysis of the safety of Llama 3 in Section 5.4.\nWe are publicly releasing all three Llama 3 models under an updated version of the Llama 3 Community License;\nsee https://llama.meta.com. This includes pre-trained and post-trained versions of our 405B parameter\nlanguage model and a new version of our Llama Guard model (Inan et al., 2023) for input and output safety.\nWe hope that the open release of a flagship model will spur a wave of innovation in the research community,\nand accelerate a responsible path towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nAs part of the Llama 3 development process we also develop multimodal extensions to the models, enabling\nimage recognition, video recognition, and speech understanding capabilities. These models are still under\nactive development and not yet ready for release. In addition to our language modeling results, the paper\npresents results of our initial experiments with those multimodal models.\n1The Llama 3 8B and 70B were pre-trained on multilingual data but were intended for use in English at the time.\n2\n\nCategory\nBenchmark\nLlama 3 8B\nGemma 2 9B\nMistral 7B\nLlama 3 70B\nMixtral 8x22B\nGPT 3.5 Turbo\nLlama 3 405B\nNemotron 4 340B\nGPT-4 (0125)\nGPT-4o\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\nGeneral\nMMLU (5-shot)\n69.4\n72.3\n61.1\n83.6\n76.9\n70.7\n87.3\n82.6\n85.1\n89.1\n89.9\nMMLU (0-shot, CoT)\n73.0\n72.3△\n60.5\n86.0\n79.9\n69.8\n88.6\n78.7◁\n85.4\n88.7\n88.3\nMMLU-Pro (5-shot, CoT)\n48.3\n–\n36.9\n66.4\n56.3\n49.2\n73.3\n62.7\n64.8\n74.0\n77.0\nIFEval\n80.4\n73.6\n57.6\n87.5\n72.7\n69.9\n88.6\n85.1\n84.3\n85.6\n88.0\nCode\nHumanEval (0-shot)\n72.6\n54.3\n40.2\n80.5\n75.6\n68.0\n89.0\n73.2\n86.6\n90.2\n92.0\nMBPP EvalPlus (0-shot)\n72.8\n71.7\n49.5\n86.0\n78.6\n82.0\n88.6\n72.8\n83.6\n87.8\n90.5\nMath\nGSM8K (8-shot, CoT)\n84.5\n76.7\n53.2\n95.1\n88.2\n81.6\n96.8\n92.3♢\n94.2\n96.1\n96.4♢\nMATH (0-shot, CoT)\n51.9\n44.3\n13.0\n68.0\n54.1\n43.1\n73.8\n41.1\n64.5\n76.6\n71.1\nReasoning\nARC Challenge (0-shot)\n83.4\n87.6\n74.2\n94.8\n88.7\n83.7\n96.9\n94.6\n96.4\n96.7\n96.7\nGPQA (0-shot, CoT)\n32.8\n–\n28.8\n46.7\n33.3\n30.8\n51.1\n–\n41.4\n53.6\n59.4\nTool use\nBFCL\n76.1\n–\n60.4\n84.8\n–\n85.9\n88.5\n86.5\n88.3\n80.5\n90.2\nNexus\n38.5\n30.0\n24.7\n56.7\n48.5\n37.2\n58.7\n–\n50.3\n56.1\n45.7\nLong context\nZeroSCROLLS/QuALITY\n81.0\n–\n–\n90.5\n–\n–\n95.2\n–\n95.2\n90.5\n90.5\nInfiniteBench/En.MC\n65.1\n–\n–\n78.2\n–\n–\n83.4\n–\n72.1\n82.5\n–\nNIH/Multi-needle\n98.8\n–\n–\n97.5\n–\n–\n98.1\n–\n100.0\n100.0\n90.8\nMultilingual\nMGSM (0-shot, CoT)\n68.9\n53.2\n29.9\n86.9\n71.1\n51.4\n91.6\n–\n85.9\n90.5\n91.6\nTable 2 Performance of finetuned Llama 3 models on key benchmark evaluations.

The development of our Llama 3 language\nmodels comprises two main stages:\n• Language model pre-training. We start by converting a large, multilingual text corpus to discrete tokens\nand pre-training a large language model (LLM) on the resulting data to perform next-token prediction.\nIn the language model pre-training stage, the model learns the structure of language and obtains large\namounts of knowledge about the world from the text it is “reading”. To do this effectively, pre-training\nis performed at massive scale: we pre-train a model with 405B parameters on 15.6T tokens using a\ncontext window of 8K tokens. This standard pre-training stage is followed by a continued pre-training\nstage that increases the supported context window to 128K tokens. See Section 3 for details.\n• Language model post-training. The pre-trained language model has a rich understanding of language\nbut it does not yet follow instructions or behave in the way we would expect an assistant to. We\nalign the model with human feedback in several rounds, each of which involves supervised finetuning\n(SFT) on instruction tuning data and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024).\nAt this post-training2 stage, we also integrate new capabilities, such as tool-use, and observe strong\nimprovements in other areas, such as coding and reasoning. See Section 4 for details. Finally, safety\nmitigations are also incorporated into the model at the post-training stage, the details of which are\ndescribed in Section 5.4.\nThe resulting models have a rich set of capabilities. They can answer questions in at least eight languages,\nwrite high-quality code, solve complex reasoning problems, and use tools out-of-the-box or in a zero-shot way.\nWe also perform experiments in which we add image, video, and speech capabilities to Llama 3 using a\ncompositional approach. The approach we study comprises the three additional stages illustrated in Figure 28:\n• Multi-modal encoder pre-training. We train separate encoders for images and speech. We train our\nimage encoder on large amounts of image-text pairs. This teaches the model the relation between visual\ncontent and the description of that content in natural language. Our speech encoder is trained using a\n2In this paper, we use the term “post-training” to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.\n3\n\nFigure 1 Illustration of the overall architecture and training of Llama 3. Llama 3 is a Transformer language model trained to\npredict the next token of a textual sequence. See text for details.\nself-supervised approach that masks out parts of the speech inputs and tries to reconstruct the masked\nout parts via a discrete-token representation. As a result, the model learns the structure of speech\nsignals. See Section 7 for details on the image encoder and Section 8 for details on the speech encoder.\n• Vision adapter training. We train an adapter that integrates the pre-trained image encoder into the\npre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed image-\nencoder representations into the language model. The adapter is trained on text-image pairs. This\naligns the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also\nupdate the parameters of the image encoder but we intentionally do not update the language-model\nparameters. We also train a video adapter on top of the image adapter on paired video-text data. This\nenables the model to aggregate information across frames. See Section 7 for details.\n• Speech adapter training. Finally, we integrate the speech encoder into the model via an adapter that\nconverts speech encodings into token representations that can be fed directly into the finetuned language\nmodel. The parameters of the adapter and encoder are jointly updated in a supervised finetuning stage\nto enable high-quality speech understanding. We do not change the language model during speech\nadapter training. We also integrate a text-to-speech system. See Section 8 for details.\nOur multimodal experiments lead to models that can recognize the content of images and videos, and support\ninteraction via a speech interface. These models are still under development and not yet ready for release.\n3\nPre-Training\nLanguage model pre-training involves: (1) the curation and filtering of a large-scale training corpus, (2) the\ndevelopment of a model architecture and corresponding scaling laws for determining model size, (3) the\ndevelopment of techniques for efficient pre-training at large scale, and (4) the development of a pre-training\nrecipe. We present each of these components separately below.\n3.1\nPre-Training Data\nWe create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge\nuntil the end of 2023. We apply several de-duplication methods and data cleaning mechanisms on each data\nsource to obtain high-quality tokens. We remove domains that contain large amounts of personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), and domains with known adult content.\n3.1.1\nWeb Data Curation\nMuch of the data we utilize is obtained from the web and we describe our cleaning process below.\nPII and safety filtering. Among other mitigations, we implement filters designed to remove data from websites\nare likely to contain unsafe content or high volumes of PII, domains that have been ranked as harmful\naccording to a variety of Meta safety standards, and domains that are known to contain adult content.\n4\n\nText extraction and cleaning. We process the raw HTML content for non-truncated web documents to extract\nhigh-quality diverse text. To do so, we build a custom parser that extracts the HTML content and optimizes\nfor precision in boilerplate removal and content recall. We evaluate our parser’s quality in human evaluations,\ncomparing it with popular third-party HTML parsers that optimize for article-like content, and found it\nto perform favorably. We carefully process HTML pages with mathematics and code content to preserve\nthe structure of that content. We maintain the image alt attribute text since mathematical content is often\nrepresented as pre-rendered images where the math is also provided in the alt attribute. We experimentally\nevaluate different cleaning configurations. We find markdown is harmful to the performance of a model that\nis primarily trained on web data compared to plain text, so we remove all markdown markers.\nDe-duplication. We apply several rounds of de-duplication at the URL, document, and line level:\n• URL-level de-duplication. We perform URL-level de-duplication across the entire dataset. We keep the\nmost recent version for pages corresponding to each URL.\n• Document-level de-duplication. We perform global MinHash (Broder, 1997) de-duplication across the\nentire dataset to remove near duplicate documents.\n• Line-level de-duplication. We perform aggressive line-level de-duplication similar to ccNet (Wenzek\net al., 2019). We remove lines that appeared more than 6 times in each bucket of 30M documents.\nAlthough our manual qualitative analysis showed that the line-level de-duplication removes not only\nleftover boilerplate from various websites such as navigation menus, cookie warnings, but also frequent\nhigh-quality text, our empirical evaluations showed strong improvements.\nHeuristic filtering. We develop heuristics to remove additional low-quality documents, outliers, and documents\nwith excessive repetitions. Some examples of heuristics include:\n• We use duplicated n-gram coverage ratio (Rae et al., 2021) to remove lines that consist of repeated\ncontent such as logging or error messages. Those lines could be very long and unique, hence cannot be\nfiltered by line-dedup.\n• We use “dirty word” counting (Raffel et al., 2020) to filter out adult websites that are not covered by\ndomain block lists.\n• We use a token-distribution Kullback-Leibler divergence to filter out documents containing excessive\nnumbers of outlier tokens compared to the training corpus distribution.\nModel-based quality filtering. Further, we experiment with applying various model-based quality classifiers\nto sub-select high-quality tokens. These include using fast classifiers such as fasttext (Joulin et al., 2017)\ntrained to recognize if a given text would be referenced by Wikipedia (Touvron et al., 2023a), as well as more\ncompute-intensive Roberta-based classifiers (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on Llama 2 predictions. To train a\nquality classifier based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents, describe the quality\nrequirements, and instruct Llama 2’s chat model to determine if the documents meets these requirements. We\nuse DistilRoberta (Sanh et al., 2019) to generate quality scores for each document for efficiency reasons. We\nexperimentally evaluate the efficacy of various quality filtering configurations.\nCode and reasoning data. Similar to DeepSeek-AI et al. (2024), we build domain-specific pipelines that extract\ncode and math-relevant web pages. Specifically, both the code and reasoning classifiers are DistilRoberta\nmodels trained on web data annotated by Llama 2. Unlike the general quality classifier mentioned above, we\nconduct prompt tuning to target web pages containing math deduction, reasoning in STEM areas and code\ninterleaved with natural language. Since the token distribution of code and math is substantially different\nthan that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-specific HTML extraction, customized text\nfeatures and heuristics for filtering.\nMultilingual data. Similar to our processing pipelines for English described above, we implement filters to\nremove data from websites that are likely to contain PII or unsafe content. Our multilingual text processing\npipeline has several unique features:\n• We use a fasttext-based language identification model to categorize documents into 176 languages.\n• We perform document-level and line-level de-duplication within data for each language.\n5\n\n• We apply language-specific heuristics and model-based filters to remove low-quality documents.\nIn addition, we perform quality ranking of multilingual documents using a multilingual Llama 2-based classifier\nto ensure that high-quality content is prioritized. We determine the amount of multilingual tokens used in\npre-training experimentally, balancing model performance on English and multilingual benchmarks.\n3.1.2\nDetermining the Data Mix\nTo obtain a high-quality language model, it is essential to carefully determine the proportion of different data\nsources in the pre-training data mix. Our main tools in determining this data mix are knowledge classification\nand scaling law experiments.\nKnowledge classification. We develop a classifier to categorize the types of information contained in our web\ndata to more effectively determine a data mix. We use this classifier to downsample data categories that are\nover-represented on the web, for example, arts and entertainment.\nScaling laws for data mix. To determine the best data mix, we perform scaling law experiments in which we\ntrain several small models on a data mix and use that to predict the performance of a large model on that mix\n(see Section 3.2.1). We repeat this process multiple times for different data mixes to select a new data mix\ncandidate. Subsequently, we train a larger model on this candidate data mix and evaluate the performance of\nthat model on several key benchmarks.\nData mix summary. Our final data mix contains roughly 50% of tokens corresponding to general knowledge,\n25% of mathematical and reasoning tokens, 17% code tokens, and 8% multilingual tokens.\n3.1.3\nAnnealing Data\nEmpirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical\ndata can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks. Akin to Li et al. (2024b), we\nperform annealing with a data mix that upsamples high-quality data in select domains. We do not include\nany training sets from commonly used benchmarks in our annealing data. This enables us to assess the true\nfew-shot learning capabilities and out-of-domain generalization of Llama 3.\nFollowing OpenAI (2023a), we evaluate the efficacy of annealing on the GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and\nMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) training sets in annealing. We find that annealing improved the performance\nof a pre-trained Llama 3 8B model on the GSM8k and MATH validation sets by 24.0% and 6.4%, respectively.\nHowever, the improvements on the 405B model are negligible, suggesting that our flagship model has strong\nin-context learning and reasoning capabilities and does not require specific in-domain training samples to\nobtain strong performance.\nUsing annealing to assess data quality. Similar to Blakeney et al. (2024), we find that annealing enables us to\njudge the value of small domain-specific datasets. We measure the value of such datasets by annealing the\nlearning rate of a 50% trained Llama 3 8B model linearly to 0 on 40B tokens. In those experiments, we assign\n30% weight to the new dataset and the remaining 70% weight to the default data mix. Using annealing to\nevaluate new data sources is more efficient than performing scaling law experiments for every small dataset.\n3.2\nModel Architecture\nLlama 3 uses a standard, dense Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). It does not deviate significantly\nfrom Llama and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) in terms of model architecture; our performance gains are\nprimarily driven by improvements in data quality and diversity as well as by increased training scale.\nWe make a few small modifications compared to Llama 2:\n• We use grouped query attention (GQA; Ainslie et al. (2023)) with 8 key-value heads to improve inference\nspeed and to reduce the size of key-value caches during decoding.\n• We use an attention mask that prevents self-attention between different documents within the same\nsequence. We find that this change had limited impact during in standard pre-training, but find it to be\nimportant in continued pre-training on very long sequences.\n6\n\n8B\n70B\n405B\nLayers\n32\n80\n126\nModel Dimension\n4,096\n8192\n16,384\nFFN Dimension\n14,336\n28,672\n53,248\nAttention Heads\n32\n64\n128\nKey/Value Heads\n8\n8\n8\nPeak Learning Rate\n3 × 10−4\n1.5 × 10−4\n8 × 10−5\nActivation Function\nSwiGLU\nVocabulary Size\n128,000\nPositional Embeddings\nRoPE (θ = 500, 000)\nTable 3 Overview of the key hyperparameters of Llama 3. We display settings for 8B, 70B, and 405B language models.\n• We use a vocabulary with 128K tokens. Our token vocabulary combines 100K tokens from the tiktoken3\ntokenizer with 28K additional tokens to better support non-English languages. Compared to the Llama\n2 tokenizer, our new tokenizer improves compression rates on a sample of English data from 3.17 to\n3.94 characters per token. This enables the model to “read” more text for the same amount of training\ncompute. We also found that adding 28K tokens from select non-English languages improved both\ncompression ratios and downstream performance, with no impact on English tokenization.\n• We increase the RoPE base frequency hyperparameter to 500,000. This enables us to better support\nlonger contexts; Xiong et al. (2023) showed this value to be effective for context lengths up to 32,768.\nLlama 3 405B uses an architecture with 126 layers, a token representation dimension of 16,384, and 128\nattention heads; see Table 3 for details. This leads to a model size that is approximately compute-optimal\naccording to scaling laws on our data for our training budget of 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs.\n3.2.1\nScaling Laws\nWe develop scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) to determine the optimal model size for\nour flagship model given our pre-training compute budget. In addition to determining the optimal model size,\na major challenge is to forecast the flagship model’s performance on downstream benchmark tasks, due to a\ncouple of issues: (1) Existing scaling laws typically predict only next-token prediction loss rather than specific\nbenchmark performance. (2) Scaling laws can be noisy and unreliable because they are developed based on\npre-training runs conducted with small compute budgets (Wei et al., 2022b).\nTo address these challenges, we implement a two-stage methodology to develop scaling laws that accurately\npredict downstream benchmark performance:\n1. We first establish a correlation between the compute-optimal model’s negative log-likelihood on down-\nstream tasks and the training FLOPs.\n2. Next, we correlate the negative log-likelihood on downstream tasks with task accuracy, utilizing both the\nscaling law models and older models trained with higher compute FLOPs. In this step, we specifically\nleverage the Llama 2 family of models.\nThis approach enables us to predict downstream task performance given a specific number of training FLOPs\nfor compute-optimal models. We use a similar method to select our pre-training data mix (see Section 3.4).\nScaling law experiments. Concretely, we construct our scaling laws by pre-training models using compute\nbudgets between 6 × 1018 FLOPs and 1022 FLOPs. At each compute budget, we pre-train models ranging\nin size between 40M and 16B parameters, using a subset of model sizes at each compute budget. In these\ntraining runs, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with a linear warmup for 2,000 training steps. The peak\nlearning rate is set between 2 × 10−4 and 4 × 10−4 depending on the size of the model. We set the cosine\ndecay to 0.1 of the peak value. The weight decay at each step is set to 0.1 times the learning rate at that step.\nWe use a fixed batch size for each compute scale, ranging between 250K and 4M.\n3https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/tree/main\n7\n\n1010\n1011\n1012\nTraining Tokens\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n0.85\n0.90\n0.95\nValidation Loss\nCompute\n6e18\n1e19\n3e19\n6e19\n1e20\n3e20\n6e20\n1e21\n3e21\n1e22\nFigure 2 Scaling law IsoFLOPs curves between 6 × 1018\nand 1022 FLOPs.\nThe loss is the negative log-\nlikelihood on a held-out validation set.

We include the fitted scaling-law prediction\nas well. The compute-optimal models correspond to\nthe parabola minimums in Figure 2.\nThese experiments give rise to the IsoFLOPs curves in Figure 2. The loss in these curves is measured on\na separate validation set. We fit the measured loss values using a second-degree polynomial and identify\nthe minimums of each parabola. We refer to minimum of a parabola as the compute-optimal model at the\ncorresponding pre-training compute budget.\nWe use the compute-optimal models we identified this way to predict the optimal number of training tokens\nfor a specific compute budget. To do so, we assume a power-law relation between compute budget, C, and\nthe optimal number of training tokens, N ⋆(C):\nN ⋆(C) = ACα.\nWe fit A and α using the data from Figure 2. We find that (α, A) = (0.53, 0.29); the corresponding fit is\nshown in Figure 3. Extrapolation of the resulting scaling law to 3.8 × 1025 FLOPs suggests training a 402B\nparameter model on 16.55T tokens.\nAn important observation is that IsoFLOPs curves become flatter around the minimum as the compute\nbudget increases. This implies that performance of the flagship model is relatively robust to small changes in\nthe trade-off between model size and training tokens. Based on this observation, we ultimately decided to\ntrain a flagship model with 405B parameters.\nPredicting performance on downstream tasks. We use the resulting compute-optimal models to forecast\nthe performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on benchmark data sets. First, we linearly correlate the\n(normalized) negative log-likelihood of correct answer in the benchmark and the training FLOPs. In this\nanalysis, we use only the scaling law models trained up to 1022 FLOPs on the data mix described above. Next,\nwe establish a sigmoidal relation between the log-likelihood and accuracy using both the scaling law models\nand Llama 2 models, which were trained using the Llama 2 data mix and tokenizer. We show the results of\nthis experiment on the ARC Challenge benchmark in Figure 4). We find this two-step scaling law prediction,\nwhich extrapolates over four orders of magnitude, to be quite accurate: it only slightly underestimates the\nfinal performance of the flagship Llama 3 model.\n3.3\nInfrastructure, Scaling, and Efficiency\nWe describe our hardware and infrastructure that powered Llama 3 405B pre-training at scale and discuss\nseveral optimizations that leads to improvements in training efficiency.\n3.3.1\nTraining Infrastructure\nThe Llama 1 and 2 models were trained on Meta’s AI Research SuperCluster (Lee and Sengupta, 2022). As\nwe scaled further, the training for Llama 3 was migrated to Meta’s production clusters (Lee et al., 2024).This\n8\n\n1020\n1021\n1022\n1023\n1024\n1025\nCompute (FLOPs)\n1.200\n1.225\n1.250\n1.275\n1.300\n1.325\n1.350\n1.375\n1.400\nNormalized NLL per Char.\n1.20\n1.25\n1.30\n1.35\n1.40\nNormalized NLL per Char.\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nAccuracy\nScaling Law Models\nLlama 2 Models\nScaling Law Prediction\nLlama 3 405B\nFigure 4 Scaling law forecast for ARC Challenge.

Right: ARC Challenge benchmark accuracy as a\nfunction of the normalized negative log-likelihood of the correct answer. This analysis enables us to predict model\nperformance on the ARC Challenge benchmark before pre-training commences. See text for details.\nsetup optimizes for production-grade reliability, which is essential as we scale up training.\nCompute. Llama 3 405B is trained on up to 16K H100 GPUs, each running at 700W TDP with 80GB HBM3,\nusing Meta’s Grand Teton AI server platform (Matt Bowman, 2022). Each server is equipped with eight GPUs\nand two CPUs. Within a server, the eight GPUs are connected via NVLink. Training jobs are scheduled\nusing MAST (Choudhury et al., 2024), Meta’s global-scale training scheduler.\nStorage. Tectonic (Pan et al., 2021), Meta’s general-purpose distributed file system, is used to build a storage\nfabric (Battey and Gupta, 2024) for Llama 3 pre-training. It offers 240 PB of storage out of 7,500 servers\nequipped with SSDs, and supports a sustainable throughput of 2 TB/s and a peak throughput of 7 TB/s. A\nmajor challenge is supporting the highly bursty checkpoint writes that saturate the storage fabric for short\ndurations. Checkpointing saves each GPU’s model state, ranging from 1 MB to 4 GB per GPU, for recovery\nand debugging. We aim to minimize GPU pause time during checkpointing and increase checkpoint frequency\nto reduce the amount of lost work after a recovery.\nNetwork. Llama 3 405B used RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) fabric based on the Arista 7800\nand Minipack2 Open Compute Project4 OCP rack switches. Smaller models in the Llama 3 family were\ntrained using Nvidia Quantum2 Infiniband fabric. Both RoCE and Infiniband clusters leverage 400 Gbps\ninterconnects between GPUs. Despite the underlying network technology differences between these clusters,\nwe tune both of them to provide equivalent performance for these large training workloads. We elaborate\nfurther on our RoCE network since we fully own its design.\n• Network topology. Our RoCE-based AI cluster comprises 24K GPUs5 connected by a three-layer Clos\nnetwork (Lee et al., 2024). At the bottom layer, each rack hosts 16 GPUs split between two servers and\nconnected by a single Minipack2 top-of-the-rack (ToR) switch. In the middle layer, 192 such racks are\nconnected by Cluster Switches to form a pod of 3,072 GPUs with full bisection bandwidth, ensuring no\noversubscription. At the top layer, eight such pods within the same datacenter building are connected via\nAggregation Switches to form a cluster of 24K GPUs. However, network connectivity at the aggregation\nlayer does not maintain full bisection bandwidth and instead has an oversubscription ratio of 1:7. Our\nmodel parallelism methods (see Section 3.3.2) and training job scheduler (Choudhury et al., 2024) are\nall optimized to be aware of network topology, aiming to minimize network communication across pods.\n• Load balancing. LLM training produces fat network flows that are hard to load balance across all\navailable network paths using traditional methods such as Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. To\naddress this challenge, we employ two techniques. First, our collective library creates 16 network flows\nbetween two GPUs, instead of just one, thereby reducing the traffic per flow and providing more flows\n4Open Compute Project: https://www.opencompute.org/\n5Note that we use only up to 16K of these 24K GPUs for Llama 3 pre-training.\n9\n\nGPUs\nTP\nCP\nPP\nDP\nSeq.

See text and Figure 5 for descriptions\nof each type of parallelism.\nfor load balancing. Second, our Enhanced-ECMP (E-ECMP) protocol effectively balances these 16 flows\nacross different network paths by hashing on additional fields in the RoCE header of packets.\n• Congestion control. We use deep-buffer switches in the spine (Gangidi et al., 2024) to accommodate\ntransient congestion and buffering caused by collective communication patterns. This setup helps\nlimit the impact of persistent congestion and network back pressure caused by slow servers, which is\ncommon in training. Finally, better load balancing through E-ECMP significantly reduces the chance\nof congestion. With these optimizations, we successfully run a 24K GPU cluster without traditional\ncongestion control methods such as Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN).\n3.3.2\nParallelism for Model Scaling\nTo scale training for our largest models, we use 4D parallelism—a combination of four different types of\nparallelism methods—to shard the model. This approach efficiently distributes computation across many\nGPUs and ensures each GPU’s model parameters, optimizer states, gradients, and activations fit in its\nHBM. Our implementation of 4D parallelism is illustrated in Figure 5. It combines tensor parallelism (TP;\nKrizhevsky et al. (2012); Shoeybi et al. (2019); Korthikanti et al. (2023)), pipeline parallelism (PP; Huang\net al. (2019); Narayanan et al. (2021); Lamy-Poirier (2023)), context parallelism (CP; Liu et al. (2023a)), and\ndata parallelism (DP; Rajbhandari et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2023b)).\nTensor parallelism splits individual weight tensors into multiple chunks on different devices. Pipeline parallelism\npartitions the model vertically into stages by layers, so that different devices can process in parallel different\nstages of the full model pipeline. Context parallelism divides the input context into segments, reducing memory\nbottleneck for very long sequence length inputs. We use fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP; Rajbhandari\net al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023b), which shards the model, optimizer, and gradients while\nimplementing data parallelism which processes data in parallel on multiple GPUs and synchronizes after each\ntraining step. Our use of FSDP for Llama 3 shards optimizer states and gradients, but for model shards we do\nnot reshard after forward computation to avoid an extra all-gather communication during backward passes.\nGPU utilization. Through careful tuning of the parallelism configuration, hardware, and software, we achieve\nan overall BF16 Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU; Chowdhery et al. (2023)) of 38-43% for the configurations\nshown in Table 4. The slight drop in MFU to 41% on 16K GPUs with DP=128 compared to 43% on 8K\nGPUs with DP=64 is due to the lower batch size per DP group needed to keep the global tokens per batch\nconstant during training.\nPipeline parallelism improvements. We encountered several challenges with existing implementations:\n• Batch size constraint. Current implementations have constraints on supported batch size per GPU,\nrequiring it to be divisible by the number of pipeline stages. For the example in Figure 6, the depth-first\nschedule (DFS) of pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) requires N = PP = 4, while the\nbreadth-first schedule (BFS; Lamy-Poirier (2023)) requires N = M, where M is the total number\nof micro-batches and N is the number of contiguous micro-batches for the same stage’s forward or\nbackward. However, pre-training often needs flexibility to adjust batch size.\n• Memory imbalance. Existing pipeline parallelism implementations lead to imbalanced resource consump-\ntion. The first stage consumes more memory due to the embedding and the warm-up micro-batches.\n• Computation imbalance. After the last layer of the model, we need to calculate output and loss, making\nthis stage the execution latency bottleneck.\n10\n\nFigure 5 Illustration of 4D parallelism. GPUs are divided into parallelism groups in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP], where\nDP stands for FSDP. In this example, 16 GPUs are configured with a group size of |TP|=2, |CP|=2, |PP|=2, and\n|DP|=2. A GPU’s position in 4D parallelism is represented as a vector, [D1, D2, D3, D4], where Di is the index on\nthe i-th parallelism dimension. In this example, GPU0[TP0, CP0, PP0, DP0] and GPU1[TP1, CP0, PP0, DP0] are in\nthe same TP group, GPU0 and GPU2 are in the same CP group, GPU0 and GPU4 are in the same PP group, and\nGPU0 and GPU8 are in the same DP group.\nTo address these issues, we modify our pipeline schedule as shown in Figure 6, which allows setting N\nflexibly—in this case N = 5, which can run a arbitrary number of micro-batches in each batch. This allows\nus to run: (1) fewer micro-batches than the number of stages when we have batch size limit at large scale;\nor (2) more micro-batches to hide point-to-point communication, finding a sweet spot between DFS and\nbreadth first schedule (BFS) for the best communication and memory efficiency. To balance the pipeline,\nwe reduce one Transformer layer each from the first and the last stages, respectively. This means that\nthe first model chunk on the first stage has only the embedding, and the last model chunk on the last\nstage has only output projection and loss calculation. To reduce pipeline bubbles, we use an interleaved\nschedule (Narayanan et al., 2021) with V pipeline stages on one pipeline rank. Overall pipeline bubble ratio\nis PP−1\nV ∗M . Further, we adopt asynchronous point-to-point communication in PP, which considerably speeds up\ntraining, especially in cases when the document mask introduces extra computation imbalance. We enable\nTORCH_NCCL_AVOID_RECORD_STREAMS to reduce memory usage from asynchronous point-to-point\ncommunication. Finally, to reduce memory cost, based on detailed memory allocation profiling, we proactively\ndeallocate tensors that will not be used for future computation, including the input and output tensors of each\npipeline stage, that will not be used for future computation. With these optimizations, we could pre-train\nLlama 3 on sequences of 8K tokens without activation checkpointing.\nContext parallelism for long sequences. We utilize context parallelism (CP) to improve memory efficiency when\nscaling the context length of Llama 3 and enable training on extremely long sequences up to 128K in length.\nIn CP, we partition across the sequence dimension, and specifically we partition the input sequence into\n2 × CP chunks so each CP rank receives two chunks for better load balancing. The i-th CP rank received\nboth the i-th and the (2 × CP −1 −i)-th chunks.\nDifferent from existing CP implementations that overlap communication and computation in a ring-like\nstructure (Liu et al., 2023a), our CP implementation adopts an all-gather based method where we first\nall-gather the key (K) and value (V) tensors, and then compute attention output for the local query (Q)\ntensor chunk. Although the all-gather communication latency is exposed in the critical path, we still adopt\nthis approach for two main reasons: (1) it is easier and more flexible to support different types of attention\nmasks in all-gather based CP attention, such as the document mask; and (2) the exposed all-gather latency\n11\n\nFigure 6 Illustration of pipeline parallelism in Llama 3. Pipeline parallelism partitions eight pipeline stages (0 to 7) across\nfour pipeline ranks (PP ranks 0 to 3), where the GPUs with rank 0 run stages 0 and 4, the GPUs with P rank 1 run\nstages 1 and 5, etc. The colored blocks (0 to 9) represent a sequence of micro-batches, where M is the total number of\nmicro-batches and N is the number of continuous micro-batches for the same stage’s forward or backward. Our key\ninsight is to make N tunable.\nis small as the communicated K and V tensors are much smaller than Q tensor due to the use of GQA (Ainslie\net al., 2023). Hence, the time complexity of attention computation is an order of magnitude larger than\nall-gather (O(S2) versus O(S), where S represents the sequence length in the full causal mask), making the\nall-gather overhead negligible.\nNetwork-aware parallelism configuration. The order of parallelism dimensions, [TP, CP, PP, DP], is optimized\nfor network communication. The innermost parallelism requires the highest network bandwidth and lowest\nlatency, and hence is usually constrained to within the same server. The outermost parallelism may spread\nacross a multi-hop network and should tolerate higher network latency. Therefore, based on the requirements\nfor network bandwidth and latency, we place parallelism dimensions in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP]. DP\n(i.e., FSDP) is the outermost parallelism because it can tolerate longer network latency by asynchronously\nprefetching sharded model weights and reducing gradients. Identifying the optimal parallelism configuration\nwith minimal communication overhead while avoiding GPU memory overflow is challenging. We develop a\nmemory consumption estimator and a performance-projection tool which helped us explore various parallelism\nconfigurations and project overall training performance and identify memory gaps effectively.\nNumerical stability. By comparing training loss between different parallelism setups, we fixed several numerical\nissues that impact training stability. To ensure training convergence, we use FP32 gradient accumulation\nduring backward computation over multiple micro-batches and also reduce-scatter gradients in FP32 across\ndata parallel workers in FSDP. For intermediate tensors, e.g., vision encoder outputs, that are used multiple\ntimes in the forward computation, the backward gradients are also accumulated in FP32.\n3.3.3\nCollective Communication\nOur collective communication library for Llama 3 is based on a fork of Nvidia’s NCCL library, called NCCLX.\nNCCLX significantly improves the performance of NCCL, especially for higher latency networks. Recall that\nthe order of parallelism dimensions is [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP corresponds to FSDP. The outermost\nparallelism dimensions, PP and DP, may communicate through a multi-hop network, with latency up to tens\nof microseconds. The original NCCL collectives—all-gather and reduce-scatter in FSDP, and point-to-point\nin PP—require data chunking and staged data copy. This approach incurs several inefficiencies, including\n(1) requiring a large number of small control messages to be exchanged over the network to facilitate data\ntransfer, (2) extra memory-copy operations, and (3) using extra GPU cycles for communication. For Llama 3\ntraining, we address a subset of these inefficiencies by tuning chunking and data transfer to fit our network\nlatencies, which can be as high as tens of microseconds for a large cluster. We also allow small control messages\nto traverse our network at a higher priority, especially avoiding being head-of-line blocked in deep-buffer\ncore switches. Our ongoing work for future Llama versions involves making deeper changes in NCCLX to\nholistically address all the aforementioned problems.\n12\n\nComponent\nCategory\nInterruption Count\n% of Interruptions\nFaulty GPU\nGPU\n148\n30.1%\nGPU HBM3 Memory\nGPU\n72\n17.2%\nSoftware Bug\nDependency\n54\n12.9%\nNetwork Switch/Cable\nNetwork\n35\n8.4%\nHost Maintenance\nUnplanned\nMaintenance\n32\n7.6%\nGPU SRAM Memory\nGPU\n19\n4.5%\nGPU System Processor\nGPU\n17\n4.1%\nNIC\nHost\n7\n1.7%\nNCCL Watchdog Timeouts\nUnknown\n7\n1.7%\nSilent Data Corruption\nGPU\n6\n1.4%\nGPU Thermal Interface + Sensor\nGPU\n6\n1.4%\nSSD\nHost\n3\n0.7%\nPower Supply\nHost\n3\n0.7%\nServer Chassis\nHost\n2\n0.5%\nIO Expansion Board\nHost\n2\n0.5%\nDependency\nDependency\n2\n0.5%\nCPU\nHost\n2\n0.5%\nSystem Memory\nHost\n2\n0.5%\nTable 5 Root-cause categorization of unexpected interruptions during a 54-day period of Llama 3 405B pre-training. About\n78% of unexpected interruptions were attributed to confirmed or suspected hardware issues.\n3.3.4\nReliability and Operational Challenges\nThe complexity and potential failure scenarios of 16K GPU training surpass those of much larger CPU clusters\nthat we have operated. Moreover, the synchronous nature of training makes it less fault-tolerant—a single\nGPU failure may require a restart of the entire job. Despite these challenges, for Llama 3, we achieved higher\nthan 90% effective training time while supporting automated cluster maintenance, such as firmware and Linux\nkernel upgrades (Vigraham and Leonhardi, 2024), which resulted in at least one training interruption daily.\nThe effective training time measures the time spent on useful training over the elapsed time.\nDuring a 54-day snapshot period of pre-training, we experienced a total of 466 job interruptions. Of these, 47\nwere planned interruptions due to automated maintenance operations such as firmware upgrades or operator-\ninitiated operations like configuration or dataset updates. The remaining 419 were unexpected interruptions,\nwhich are classified in Table 5. Approximately 78% of the unexpected interruptions are attributed to confirmed\nhardware issues, such as GPU or host component failures, or suspected hardware-related issues like silent data\ncorruption and unplanned individual host maintenance events. GPU issues are the largest category, accounting\nfor 58.7% of all unexpected issues. Despite the large number of failures, significant manual intervention was\nrequired only three times during this period, with the rest of issues handled by automation.\nTo increase the effective training time, we reduced job startup and checkpointing time, and developed tools\nfor fast diagnosis and problem resolution. We extensively use PyTorch’s built-in NCCL flight recorder (Ansel\net al., 2024), a feature that captures collective metadata and stack traces into a ring buffer, and hence allowing\nus to diagnose hangs and performance issues quickly at scale, particularly with regard to NCCLX. Using\nthis, we efficiently record every communication event and the duration of each collective operation, and also\nautomatically dump tracing data on NCCLX watchdog or heartbeat timeout. We enable more computationally\nintensive tracing operations and metadata collection selectively as needed live in production through online\nconfiguration changes (Tang et al., 2015) without needing a code release or job restart.\nDebugging issues in large-scale training is complicated by the mixed use of NVLink and RoCE in our network.\nData transfer over NVLink typically occurs through load/store operations issued by CUDA kernels, and\nfailures in either the remote GPU or NVLink connectivity often manifest as stalled load/store operations\nwithin CUDA kernels without returning a clear error code. NCCLX enhances the speed and accuracy of failure\n13\n\ndetection and localization through a tight co-design with PyTorch, allowing PyTorch to access NCCLX’s\ninternal state and track relevant information. While stalls due to NVLink failures cannot be completely\nprevented, our system monitors the state of the communication library and automatically times out when\nsuch a stall is detected. Additionally, NCCLX traces the kernel and network activities of each NCCLX\ncommunication and provides a snapshot of the failing NCCLX collective’s internal state, including finished\nand pending data transfers between all ranks. We analyze this data to debug NCCLX scaling issues.\nSometimes, hardware issues may cause still-functioning but slow stragglers that are hard to detect. Even a single\nstraggler can slow down thousands of other GPUs, often appearing as functioning but slow communications.\nWe developed tools to prioritize potentially problematic communications from selected process groups. By\ninvestigating just a few top suspects, we were usually able to effectively identify the stragglers.\nOne interesting observation is the impact of environmental factors on training performance at scale. For\nLlama 3 405B , we noted a diurnal 1-2% throughput variation based on time-of-day. This fluctuation is the\nresult of higher mid-day temperatures impacting GPU dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.\nDuring training, tens of thousands of GPUs may increase or decrease power consumption at the same time,\nfor example, due to all GPUs waiting for checkpointing or collective communications to finish, or the startup\nor shutdown of the entire training job. When this happens, it can result in instant fluctuations of power\nconsumption across the data center on the order of tens of megawatts, stretching the limits of the power grid.\nThis is an ongoing challenge for us as we scale training for future, even larger Llama models.\n3.4\nTraining Recipe\nThe recipe used to pre-train Llama 3 405B consists of three main stages: (1) initial pre-training, (2) long-context\npre-training, and (3) annealing. The three stages are described separately below. We use similar recipes to\npre-train the 8B and 70B models.\n3.4.1\nInitial Pre-Training\nWe pre-train Llama 3 405B using AdamW with a peak learning rate of 8 × 10−5 , a linear warm up of 8,000\nsteps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to 8 × 10−7 over 1,200,000 steps. We use a lower batch size\nearly in training to improve training stability, and increase it subsequently to improve efficiency. Specifically,\nwe use an initial batch size of 4M tokens and sequences of length 4,096, and double these values to a batch\nsize of 8M sequences of 8,192 tokens after pre-training 252M tokens. We double the batch size again to 16M\nafter pre-training on 2.87T tokens. We found this training recipe to be very stable: we observed few loss\nspikes and did not require interventions to correct for model training divergence.\nAdjusting the data mix. We made a several adjustments to the pre-training data mix during training to improve\nmodel performance on particular downstream tasks. In particular, we increased the percentage of non-English\ndata during pre-training to improve the multilingual performance of Llama 3. We also upsample mathematical\ndata to improve the model’s mathematical reasoning performance, we added more recent web data in the\nlater stages of pre-training to advance the model’s knowledge cut-off, and we downsampled subsets of the\npre-training data that were later identified as being lower quality.\n3.4.2\nLong Context Pre-Training\nIn the final stages of pre-training, we train on long sequences to support context windows of up to 128K tokens.\nWe do not train on long sequences earlier because the compute in self-attention layers grows quadratically in\nthe sequence length. We increase the supported context length in increments, pre-training until the model has\nsuccessfully adapted to the increased context length. We assess successful adaptation by measuring whether (1)\nmodel performance on short-context evaluations has recovered completely and (2) the model perfectly solves\n“needle in a haystack” tasks up to that length. In Llama 3 405B pre-training, we increased context length\ngradually in six stages, starting from the original 8K context window and ending in the final 128K context\nwindow. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 800B training tokens.\n14\n\nFigure 7 Illustration of the overall post-training approach for Llama 3. Our post-training strategy involves rejection sampling,\nsupervised finetuning, and direct preference optimization. See text for details.\n3.4.3\nAnnealing\nDuring pre-training on the final 40M tokens, we linearly annealed the learning rate to 0, maintaining a context\nlength of 128K tokens. During this annealing phase, we also adjusted the data mix to upsample data sources\nof very high quality; see Section 3.1.3. Finally, we compute the average of model checkpoints (Polyak (1991)\naveraging) during annealing to produce the final pre-trained model.\n4\nPost-Training\nWe produce the aligned Llama 3 models by applying several rounds of post-training,6 or aligning the model\nwith human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024) on top of a pre-trained checkpoint. Each\nround of post-training involves supervised finetuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO;\nRafailov et al., 2024) on examples collected either via human annotations or generated synthetically. Our\npost-training modeling and data approaches are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. We further\ndetail custom data curation strategies to improve the reasoning, coding, factuality, multilingual, tool use, long\ncontext, and precise instruction following in Section 4.3.\n4.1\nModeling\nThe backbone of our post-training strategy is a reward model and a language model. We first train a reward\nmodel on top of the pre-trained checkpoint using human-annotated preference data (see Section 4.1.2). We\nthen finetune pre-trained checkpoints with supervised finetuning (SFT; see Section 4.1.3), and further align\nthe checkpoints with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; see Section 4.1.4). This process is illustrated\nin Figure 7. Unless otherwise noted, our modeling procedure applies to Llama 3 405B, and we refer to\nLlama 3 405B as Llama 3 for simplicity.\n4.1.1\nChat Dialog Format\nTo tune LLMs for human-AI interaction, we need to define a chat dialog protocol for the model to understand\nhuman instructions and perform conversational tasks.\nCompared to its predecessor, Llama 3 has new\ncapabilities such as tool use (Section 4.3.5) which may require generating multiple messages and sending\n6We use the term “post-training” to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.\n15\n\nthem to different locations (e.g., user, ipython) within a single dialog turn. To support this, we design a new\nmulti-message chat protocol which uses various special header and termination tokens. The header tokens\nare used to indicate the source and destination of each message in a conversation. Similarly, the termination\ntokens indicate when it is the time to alternate between human and AI to speak.\n4.1.2\nReward Modeling\nWe train a reward model (RM) covering different capabilities on top of the pre-trained checkpoint. The\ntraining objective is the same as Llama 2 except that we remove the margin term in the loss, as we observe\ndiminishing improvements after data scaling. Following Llama 2, we use all of our preference data for reward\nmodeling after filtering out samples with similar responses. In addition to standard preference pair of (chosen,\nrejected) response, annotations also create a third “edited response” for some prompts, where the chosen\nresponse from the pair is further edited for improvement (see Section 4.2.1). Hence, each preference ranking\nsample has two or three responses with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). We concatenate the\nprompt and multiple responses into a single row during training with responses randomly shuffled. This is an\napproximation to the standard scenario of putting the responses in separate rows and computing the scores,\nbut in our ablations, this approach improves training efficiency without a loss in accuracy.\n4.1.3\nSupervised Finetuning\nThe reward model is then used to perform rejection sampling on our human annotation prompts, the details\nof which are described in Section 4.2. Together with this rejection-sampled data and other data sources\n(including synthetic data), we finetune the pre-trained language model using a standard cross entropy loss\non the target tokens (while masking loss on prompt tokens). More details about the data mix can be found\nin Section 4.2. We refer to this stage as supervised finetuning (SFT; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022;\nWang et al., 2022b), even though many of the training targets are model-generated. Our largest models are\nfinetuned with a learning rate of 10−5 over the course of 8.5K to 9K steps. We found these hyperparameter\nsettings to work well across different rounds and data mixes.\n4.1.4\nDirect Preference Optimization\nWe further train our SFT models with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) for human\npreference alignment. For training, we primarily use the most recent batches of preference data collected using\nthe best performing models from the previous alignment rounds. As a result, our training data conforms better\nto the distribution of the policy model that is being optimized in each round. We also explored on-policy\nalgorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), but found that DPO required less compute for large-scale\nmodels and performed better, especially on instruction following benchmarks like IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023).\nFor Llama 3, we use a learning rate of 10−5 and set the β hyper-parameter to be 0.1. In addition, we apply\nthe following algorithmic modifications to DPO:\n• Masking out formatting tokens in DPO loss: We mask out special formatting tokens including header\nand termination tokens (described in Section 4.1.1) from both chosen and rejected responses in the\nloss to stabilize DPO training. We observe that having these tokens contribute to the loss may lead\nto undesired model behaviors such as tail repetition or abruptly generating termination tokens. We\nhypothesize that this is due to the contrastive nature of the DPO loss – the presence of common tokens\nin both chosen and rejected responses leads to a conflicting learning objective as the model needs to\nincrease and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.\n• Regularization with NLL loss: We add an additional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss term with a scaling\ncoefficient of 0.2 on the chosen sequences, similar to Pang et al. (2024). This helps further stabilize DPO\ntraining by maintaining desired formatting for generation and preventing the decrease of log probability\nof chosen responses (Pang et al., 2024; Pal et al., 2024).\n4.1.5\nModel Averaging\nFinally, we average models obtained from experiments using various versions of data or hyperparameters at\neach RM, SFT, or DPO stage (Izmailov et al., 2019; Wortsman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).\n16\n\n% of\nAvg. # turns\nAvg. # tokens\nAvg. # tokens\nAvg. # tokens\nDataset\ncomparisons\nper dialog\nper example\nin prompt\nin response\nGeneral English\n81.99%\n4.1\n1,000.4\n36.4\n271.2\nCoding\n6.93%\n3.2\n1,621.0\n113.8\n462.9\nMultilingual\n5.19%\n1.8\n1,299.4\n77.1\n420.9\nReasoning and tools\n5.89%\n1.6\n707.7\n46.6\n129.9\nTotal\n100%\n3.8\n1,041.6\n44.5\n284.0\nTable 6 Statistics of human preference data. We list statistics of the internally collected human preference data used for\nLlama 3 alignment. We ask annotators to perform multi-turn dialogues with the models and make comparisons among\nresponses at each turn. In post-processing, we split each dialogue to multiple examples at a turn level. Each example\nconsists of a prompt (including previous dialog if available) and a response (e.g., chosen or rejected response).\n4.1.6\nIterative Rounds\nFollowing Llama 2, we apply the above methods in six rounds. In each cycle, we collect new preference\nannotations and SFT data, sampling synthetic data from the latest models.\n4.2\nPost-training Data\nThe post-training data composition plays a critical role in the usefulness and behavior of language models. In\nthis section, we discuss our human annotation procedures and preference data collection (Section 4.2.1), the\ncomposition of our SFT data (Section 4.2.2), and methods for data quality control and cleaning (Section 4.2.3).\n4.2.1\nPreference Data\nOur preference data annotation process is similar to Llama 2. We deploy multiple models for annotation after\neach round and sample two responses from two different models for each user prompt. These models can\nbe trained with different data mixes and alignment recipes, allowing for different capability strength (e.g.,\ncode expertise) and increased data diversity. We ask annotators to rate the strength of their preference by\ncategorizing it into one of four levels, based on how much more they prefer the chosen response over the\nrejected one: significantly better, better, slightly better, or marginally better. We also incorporate an editing\nstep after preference ranking to encourage annotators to further improve the preferred response. Annotators\nedit the chosen response directly or prompt the model with feedback to refine its own response. Consequently,\na portion of our preference data has three responses ranked (edited > chosen > rejected).\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of preference annotations that we use for Llama 3 training. General English\ncovers multiple subcategories such as knowledge-based question and answering or precise instruction-following,\nwhich fall outside the scope of specific capabilities. Compared to Llama 2, we observe an increase in the\naverage length of prompt and response, suggesting that we train Llama 3 on more complex tasks. In addition,\nwe implement a quality analysis and human evaluation process to rigorously assess the data collected, allowing\nus to refine our prompts and provide systematic, actionable feedback to annotators. For example, as Llama 3\nimproves after each round, we increase prompt complexity accordingly to target areas where the model lags.\nIn each round of post-training, we use all the preference data that is available at the time for reward modeling,\nwhile only using the latest batches from various capabilities for DPO training. For both reward modeling and\nDPO, we use samples that are labeled as the chosen response being significantly better or better than the\nrejected counterpart for training and discard samples with similar responses.\n4.2.2\nSFT Data\nOur finetuning data is largely comprised of the following sources:\n• Prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses.\n• Synthetic data targeting specific capabilities (see Section 4.3 for more details).\n17\n\nAvg. # tokens\nAvg. # tokens\nDataset\n% of examples\nAvg. # turns\nAvg. # tokens\nin context\nin final response\nGeneral English\n52.66%\n6.3\n974.0\n656.7\n317.1\nCode\n14.89%\n2.7\n753.3\n378.8\n374.5\nMultilingual\n3.01%\n2.7\n520.5\n230.8\n289.7\nExam-like\n8.14%\n2.3\n297.8\n124.4\n173.4\nReasoning and tools\n21.19%\n3.1\n661.6\n359.8\n301.9\nLong context\n0.11%\n6.7\n38,135.6\n37,395.2\n740.5\nTotal\n100%\n4.7\n846.1\n535.7\n310.4\nTable 7 Statistics of SFT data. We list internally collected SFT data used for Llama 3 alignment. Each SFT example\nconsists of a context (i.e., all conversation turns except the last one) and a final response.\n• Small amounts of human-curated data (see Section 4.3 for more details).\nAs our post-training rounds progress, we develop stronger Llama 3 variants that we use to collect larger\ndatasets that cover a wide range of complex capabilities. In this section, we discuss the details for the\nrejection-sampling procedure and overall composition of our final SFT datamix.\nRejection sampling. During rejection sampling (RS), for each prompt collected during human annotation\n(Section 4.2.1) we sample K (typically between 10 and 30) outputs from the latest chat model policy (usually\nthe best performing checkpoint from the previous post-training iteration, or the best performing checkpoint\nfor a particular capability) and use our reward model to select the best candidate, consistent with Bai et al.\n(2022). In later rounds of post-training, we introduce system prompts to steer RS responses to conform with\ndesirable tone, style, or formatting, which might be different for different capabilities.\nTo increase the efficiency of rejection sampling, we adopt PagedAttention (Kwon et al., 2023). PagedAttention\nenhances memory efficiency through dynamic key-value cache allocation. It supports arbitrary output lengths\nby dynamically scheduling requests based on the current cache capacity. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of\nswap-out when running out of memory. To eliminate such swap overhead, we define a maximum output length\nand perform a request only if sufficient memory is available to fit an output with that length. PagedAttention\nalso enables us to share the key-value cache pages for a prompt across all corresponding outputs. Together,\nthis leads to a throughput improvement of over 2× during rejection sampling.\nOverall data composition. Table 7 shows data statistics for each broad category of our “helpfulness” mix. While\nSFT and preference data contain overlapping domains, they are curated differently, yielding distinct count\nstatistics. In Section 4.2.3 we describe techniques for categorizing topic, complexity, and quality of our data\nsamples. In each round of post-training, we adjust our overall data mix carefully across these axes to tune\nperformance across a wide range of benchmarks. Our final data mix epochs multiple times on some high\nquality sources and downsamples others.\n4.2.3\nData Processing and Quality Control\nGiven that most of our training data is model-generated, it requires careful cleaning and quality control.\nData cleaning. In the early rounds, we observed a number of undesirable patterns common in our data, such\nas excessive use of emojis or exclamation points. Therefore, we implement a series of rule-based data removal\nand modification strategies to filter or clean problematic data. For example, to mitigate overly-apologetic\ntonal issues, we identify overused phrases (such as “I’m sorry” or “I apologize”) and carefully balance the\nproportion of such samples in our dataset.\nData pruning. We also apply a collection of model-based techniques to remove low-quality training samples\nand improve overall model performance:\n• Topic classification: We first finetune Llama 3 8B into a topic classifier, and perform inference over\nall data to classify it into both coarsely-grained buckets (“mathematical reasoning”) and fine-grained\n18\n\nbuckets (“geometry and trigonometry”).\n• Quality scoring: We use both reward model and Llama-based signals to obtain a quality score for each\nsample. For an RM-based score, we consider data that is in the top quartile of RM scores as high quality.\nFor a Llama-based score, we prompt Llama 3 checkpoint to rate each sample on a three-point scale for\ngeneral English data (accuracy, instruction following, and tone/presentation) and a two-point scale for\ncoding data (bug identification and user intention), and consider samples that obtain the maximum\nscore as high quality. The RM and Llama-based scores have high disagreement rates, and we find that\ncombining these signals yield the best recall on our internal test set. Ultimately, we select examples\nthat are marked as high quality by the RM or the Llama-based filter.\n• Difficulty scoring: Because we are also interested in prioritizing examples that are more complex for\nthe model, we score data using two measures of difficulty: Instag (Lu et al., 2023) and Llama-based\nscoring. For Instag, we prompt Llama 3 70B to perform intention tagging of SFT prompts, where more\nintentions implies more complexity. We also prompt Llama 3 to measure the difficulty (Liu et al., 2024c)\nof dialogs on a three-point scale.\n• Semantic deduplication: Finally, we perform semantic deduplication (Abbas et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2024c). We first cluster complete dialogs using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and within each cluster\nsort them by quality score × difficulty score. We then do greedy selection by iterating through all sorted\nexamples, and only keeping the ones that have maximum cosine similarity less than a threshold to the\nexamples seen so far in the cluster.\n4.3\nCapabilities\nWe highlight special efforts to improve performance for specific capabilities such as code (Section 4.3.1),\nmultilinguality (Section 4.3.2), math and reasoning (Section 4.3.3), long context (Section 4.3.4), tool use\n(Section 4.3.5), factuality (Section 4.3.6), and steerability (Section 4.3.7).\n4.3.1\nCode\nLLMs for code have received significant attention since the release of Copilot and Codex (Chen et al., 2021).\nDevelopers are now widely using these models to generate code snippets, debug, automate tasks, and improve\ncode quality. For Llama 3, we target improving and evaluating code generation, documentation, debugging,\nand review capabilities for the following high priority programming languages: Python, Java, Javascript,\nC/C++, Typescript, Rust, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, bash/shell. Here, we present our work on improving\nthese coding capabilities via training a code expert, generating synthetic data for SFT, improving formatting\nwith system prompt steering, and creating quality filters to remove bad samples from our training data.\nExpert training. We train a code expert which we use to collect high quality human annotations for code\nthroughout subsequent rounds of post-training. This is accomplished by branching the main pre-training run\nand continuing pre-training on a 1T token mix of mostly (>85%) code data. Continued pre-training on domain-\nspecific data has been shown to be effective for improving performance in a specific domain (Gururangan\net al., 2020). We follow a recipe similar to that of CodeLlama (Rozière et al., 2023). For the last several\nthousand steps of training we perform long-context finetuning (LCFT) to extend the expert’s context length\nto 16K tokens on a high quality mix of repo-level code data. Finally, we follow the similar post-training\nmodeling recipes described in Section 4.1 to align this model, except with SFT and DPO data mixes primarily\ntargeting code. This model is also used for rejection sampling (Section 4.2.2) for coding prompts.\nSynthetic data generation. During development, we identified key issues in code generation, including difficulty\nin following instructions, code syntax errors, incorrect code generation, and difficulty in fixing bugs. While\nintensive human annotation could theoretically resolve these issues, synthetic data generation offers a\ncomplementary approach at a lower cost and higher scale, unconstrained by the expertise level of annotators.\nAs such, we use Llama 3 and the code expert to generate a large quantity of synthetic SFT dialogs.\nWe describe three high-level approaches for generating synthetic code data. In total, we generate over 2.7M\nsynthetic examples which were used during SFT.\n19\n\n1. Synthetic data generation: execution feedback. The 8B and 70B models show significant performance\nimprovements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial\nexperiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can\neven degrade performance). To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of\ntruth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large\ndataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:\n• Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem\ndescriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To\nachieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model\nto generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide\nrange of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).\n• Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming\nlanguage. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the\ngenerated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought\nprocess in comments.\n• Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is\nnot guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model’s\nquality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. To\nachieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of\nstatic and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:\n– Static analysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic\ncorrectness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported\nfunctions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.\n– Unit test generation and execution: For each problem and solution, we prompt the model\nto generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution,\ncatching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.\n• Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the\nmodel to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution,\nand feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). After a unit test\nexecution failure, the model could either fix the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit\ntests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the final\ndataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions\nwere initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution\nfeedback and improved its performance.\n• Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds,\nwith each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating\nhigher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive\nrefinement and enhancement of the model’s performance.\n2. Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between\nmajor programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This\nis not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate\nthis, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to\nless common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). This is achieved\nby prompting Llama 3 and ensuring quality via syntax parsing, compilation, and execution. Figure 8\ndemonstrates an example of synthetic PHP code translated from Python. This improves performance\nsignificantly for less common languages as measured by the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark.\n3. Synthetic data generation: backtranslation. To improve certain coding capabilities (e.g., documentation,\nexplanations) where execution feedback is less informative for determining quality, we employ an\nalternative multi-step approach. Using this procedure, we generated approximately 1.2M synthetic\n20\n\nFigure 8\nCode translation example. We display an example of using Llama 3 to translate Python code (left) to PHP\ncode (right) to augment our SFT dataset with a wider range of programming languages.\nFigure 9\nImproving generated code quality with system prompts. Left: without system prompt Right: with system prompt.\ndialogs related to code explanation, generation, documentation, and debugging. Beginning with code\nsnippets from a variety of languages in our pre-training data:\n• Generate: We prompt Llama 3 to generate data that represents our target capability (e.g., we add\ncomments and docstrings for the code snippet, or we ask the model to explain a piece of code).\n• Backtranslate: We then prompt the model to “backtranslate” the synthetically generated data to\nthe original code (e.g., we prompt the model to generate code only from its documentation, or we\nask the model to generate code only from its explanation).\n• Filter: Using the original code as a reference, we prompt the Llama 3 to determine the quality of\nthe output (e.g., we ask the model how faithful the backtranslated code is to the original). We\nthen use the generated examples that have the highest self-verification scores in SFT.\nSystem prompt steering during rejection sampling. During the rejection sampling process, we used code specific\nsystem prompts to improve code readability, documentation, thoroughness, and specificity. Recall, from\nSection 7 this data is used to finetune the language model. Figure 9 shows an example of how the system\nprompt helps improve the generated code quality — it adds necessary comments, uses more informative\nvariable names, saves memory, etc.\nFiltering training data with execution and model-as-judge signals. As described in Section 4.2.3, we occasionally\nencounter quality issues in our rejection-sampled data, such as code blocks containing bugs. Detecting these\nissues in our rejection-sampled data is not as straightforward as it is for our synthetic code data, as the\nrejection-sampled responses typically contain a mix of natural language and code for which the code may not\n21\n\nalways be expected to be executable. (For example, user prompts may explicitly ask for pseudo-code or edits to\nonly a very small snippet of an executable program.) To address this, we utilize the “model-as-judge” approach,\nwhere earlier versions of Llama 3 assess and assign a binary (0/1) score based on two criteria: code correctness\nand code style. We retain only those samples that achieve a perfect score of 2. Initially, this stringent filtering\nled to a regression in downstream benchmark performance, primarily because it disproportionately removed\nexamples with challenging prompts. To counteract this, we strategically revise the responses of some coding\ndata categorized as most challenging until they met the Llama-based “model-as-judge” criteria. By refining\nthese challenging problems, the coding data achieves a balance between quality and difficulty, resulting in\noptimal downstream performance.\n4.3.2\nMultilinguality\nWe describe how we improve Llama 3’s multilingual capabilities, including training an expert specialized on\nsubstantially more multilingual data, sourcing and generating high quality multilingual instruction tuning\ndata for German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai, and tackling specific challenges of\nmultilingual language steering to enhance the overall performance of our model.\nExpert training. Our Llama 3 pre-training data mix contains significantly more English tokens than non-English\ntokens. To collect higher quality human annotations in non-English languages, we train a multilingual expert by\nbranching off the pre-training run and continuing to pre-train on a data mix that consists of 90% multilingual\ntokens. We then perform post-training on this expert following Section 4.1. This expert model is then used to\ncollect higher quality annotations in non-English languages until pre-training was fully complete.\nMultilingual data collection. Our multilingual SFT data is derived primarily from sources described below. The\noverall distribution is 2.4% human annotations, 44.2% data from other NLP tasks, 18.8% rejection sampled\ndata, and 34.6% translated reasoning data.\n• Human annotations: We collect high-quality, manually annotated data from linguists and native speakers.\nThese annotations mostly consist of open-ended prompts that represent real world use cases.\n• Data from other NLP tasks: To further augment, we use multilingual training data from other tasks\nand rewrite into dialog format. For example, we use data from exams-qa (Hardalov et al., 2020)\nand Conic10k (Wu et al., 2023). To improve language alignment, we also use parallel texts from\nGlobalVoices (Prokopidis et al., 2016) and Wikimedia (Tiedemann, 2012). We use LID based filtering\nand Blaser2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to remove low quality data. For parallel text data,\ninstead of using the bitext pairs directly, we apply a multilingual template inspired by Wei et al. (2022a)\nto better simulate real-life conversations in translation and language learning scenarios.\n• Rejection sampled data: We apply rejection sampling on our human annotated prompts to generate\nhigh-quality samples for finetuning, with few modifications compared to the process for English data:\n– Generation: We explored randomly choosing the temperature hyperparameter from the range\n0.2 −1 for diverse generations in early rounds of post-training. With high temperature, responses\nfor multilingual prompts can get creative and inspiring, but are also susceptible to unnecessary\nor unnatural code-switching. In the final round of post-training, we use a constant value of 0.6\nto balance the trade-off. Additionally, we used specialized system prompts to improve response\nformat, structure and general readability.\n– Selection: Prior to reward model based selection, we implement multilingual-specific checks to\nensure high language-match rate between the prompt and response (e.g., a romanized Hindi prompt\nshould not expect a response in Hindi Devanagari script).\n• Translated data: We try to avoid using machine-translated data to finetune the model in order to\nprevent translationese (Bizzoni et al., 2020; Muennighoff et al., 2023) or possible name bias (Wang\net al., 2022a), gender bias (Savoldi et al., 2021), or cultural bias (Ji et al., 2023). Moreover, we aim to\nprevent the model from being exposed only to tasks that are rooted in English cultural context, which\nmay not be representative of the linguistic and cultural diversity we aim to capture. We made one\nexception to this and translated our synthetic quantitative reasoning data (see Section 4.3.3 for details)\nto improve performance in quantitative reasoning in non-English languages. Due to the simple nature of\n22\n\nthe language in these math problems, the translated samples were found to have little to no quality\nissues. We observed strong gains on MGSM (Shi et al., 2022) from adding this translated data.\n4.3.3\nMath and Reasoning\nWe define reasoning as the ability to perform multi-step computations and arrive at the correct final answer.\nSeveral challenges guide our approach to training models that excel in mathematical reasoning:\n• Lack of prompts: As the complexity of questions increases, the number of valid prompts or questions\nfor Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) decreases. This scarcity makes it difficult to create diverse and\nrepresentative training datasets for teaching models various mathematical skills (Yu et al., 2023; Yue\net al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024b).\n• Lack of ground truth chain of thought: Effective reasoning requires a step-by-step solution to facilitate\nthe reasoning process (Wei et al., 2022c). However, there is often a shortage of ground truth chains of\nthought, which are essential for guiding the model how to break down the problem step-by-step and\nreach the final answer (Zelikman et al., 2022).\n• Incorrect intermediate steps: When using model-generated chains of thought, the intermediate steps\nmay not always be correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\n2023a). This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect final answers and needs to be addressed.\n• Teaching models to use external tools: Enhancing models to utilize external tools, such as code interpreters,\nallows them to reason by interleaving code and text (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Gou et al.,\n2023). This capability can significantly improve their problem-solving abilities.\n• Discrepancy between training and inference: There is often a discrepancy between how the model is\nfinetuned during training and how it is used during inference. During inference, the finetuned model may\ninteract with humans or other models, requiring it to improve its reasoning using feedback. Ensuring\nconsistency between training and real-world usage is crucial for maintaining reasoning performance.\nTo address these challenges, we apply the following methodologies:\n• Addressing the lack of prompts: We source relevant pre-training data from mathematical contexts and\nconverted it into a question-answer format which can then be used for supervised finetuning. Additionally,\nwe identify mathematical skills where the model under-performs and actively sourced prompts from\nhumans to teach models such skills. To facilitate this process, we create a taxonomy of mathematical\nskills (Didolkar et al., 2024) and ask humans to provide relevant prompts/questions accordingly.\n• Augmenting training data with step-wise reasoning traces: We use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step\nsolutions for a set of prompts. For each prompt, the model produces a variable number of generations.\nThese generations are then filtered based on the correct answer (Li et al., 2024a). We also do self-\nverification where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid for a given\nquestion. This process improves the quality of the finetuning data by eliminating instances where the\nmodel does not produce valid reasoning traces.\n• Filtering incorrect reasoning traces: We train outcome and stepwise reward models (Lightman et al., 2023;\nWang et al., 2023a) to filter training data where the intermediate reasoning steps were incorrect. These\nreward models are used to eliminate data with invalid step-by-step reasoning, ensuring high-quality\ndata for finetuning. For more challenging prompts, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with\nlearned step-wise reward models to generate valid reasoning traces, further enhancing the collection of\nhigh-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).\n• Interleaving code and text reasoning: We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a\ncombination of textual reasoning and associated Python code (Gou et al., 2023). Code execution is used\nas a feedback signal to eliminate cases where the reasoning chain was not valid, ensuring the correctness\nof the reasoning process.\n• Learning from feedback and mistakes: To simulate human feedback, we utilize incorrect generations (i.e.,\ngenerations leading to incorrect reasoning traces) and perform error correction by prompting Llama 3 to\n23\n\nyield correct generations (An et al., 2023b; Welleck et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2024a). The iterative\nprocess of using feedback from incorrect attempts and correcting them helps improve the model’s ability\nto reason accurately and learn from its mistakes.\n4.3.4\nLong Context\nDuring the final pre-training stage, we extend the context length of Llama 3 from 8K tokens to 128K tokens\n(see Section 3.4 for more details). Similar to pre-training, we find that during finetuning we must carefully\ntune the recipe to balance short and long-context capabilities.\nSFT and synthetic data generation. Naively applying our existing SFT recipe with only short-context data\nresulted in significant regressions in long-context capabilities from pre-training, highlighting the need to\nincorporate long-context data in our SFT data mix. In practice, however, it is largely impractical to get humans\nto annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so we\npredominantly rely on synthetic data to fill this gap. We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic\ndata based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for\nlong documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below.\n• Question answering: We carefully curate a set of long documents from our pre-training mix. We split\nthese documents into chunks of 8K tokens, and prompted an earlier version of the Llama 3 model to\ngenerate QA pairs conditional on randomly selected chunks. During training, the whole document is\nused as context.\n• Summarization: We applied hierarchical summarization of long-context documents by first summarizing\nthe chunks of 8K input length using our strongest Llama 3 8K context model and then summarizing\nthe summaries. During training we provide the full document and prompt the model to summarize the\ndocument while preserving all the important details. We also generate QA pairs based on the summaries\nof the documents and prompt the model with questions that require global understanding of the whole\nlong document.\n• Long context code reasoning: We parse Python files to identify import statements and determine their\ndependencies. From here, we select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced\nby at least five other files. We remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to\nidentify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code.\nWe further categorize these synthetically generated samples based on the sequence length (16K, 32K, 64K\nand 128K) to enable more fine-grained targeting of input lengths.\nThrough careful ablations, we observe that mixing 0.1% of synthetically generated long-context data with the\noriginal short-context data optimizes the performance across both short-context and long-context benchmarks.\nDPO. We observe that using only short context training data in DPO did not negatively impact long-context\nperformance as long as the SFT model is high quality in long context tasks. We suspect this is due to the\nfact that our DPO recipe has fewer optimizer steps than SFT. Given this finding, we keep the standard\nshort-context recipe for DPO on top of our long-context SFT checkpoints.\n4.3.5\nTool Use\nTeaching LLMs to use tools such as search engines or code interpreters hugely expands the range of tasks\nthey can solve, transforming them from pure chat models into more general assistants (Nakano et al., 2021;\nThoppilan et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2024). We train\nLlama 3 to interact with the following tools:\n• Search engine. Llama 3 is trained to use Brave Search7 to answer questions about recent events that go\nbeyond its knowledge cutoff or that require retrieving a particular piece of information from the web.\n• Python interpreter. Llama 3 can generate and execute code to perform complex computations, read files\nuploaded by the user and solve tasks based on them such as question answering, summarization, data\nanalysis or visualization.\n7https://brave.com/search/api/\n24\n\n• Mathematical computational engine. Llama 3 can use the Wolfram Alpha API8 to more accurately solve\nmath, science problems, or retrieve accurate information from Wolfram’s database.\nThe resulting model is able to use these tools in a chat setup to solve the user’s queries, including in multi-turn\ndialogs. If a query requires multiple tool calls, the model can write a step-by-step plan, call the tools in\nsequence, and do reasoning after each tool call.\nWe also improve Llama 3’s zero-shot tool use capabilities — given in-context, potentially unseen tool definitions\nand a user query, we train the model to generate the correct tool call.\nImplementation. We implement our core tools as Python objects with different methods. Zero-shot tools can\nbe implemented as Python functions with descriptions, documentation (i.e., examples for how to use them),\nand the model only needs the function’s signature and docstring as context to generate the appropriate call.\nWe also convert function definitions and calls to JSON format, e.g., for web API calls. All tool calls are\nexecuted by the Python interpreter, that must be enabled in the Llama 3 system prompt. Core tools can be\nindividually enabled or disabled in the system prompt.\nData collection. Different from Schick et al. (2024), we rely on human annotations and preferences to teach\nLlama 3 to use tools. There are two main differences with the post-training pipeline generally used in Llama 3:\n• For tools, dialogs often contain more than a single assistant message (e.g., calling the tool and reasoning\nabout the tool output). Thus, we annotate at the message level to collect granular feedback: annotators\nprovide a preference between two assistant messages with the same context or, if both contain major\nproblems, edit one of the messages. The chosen or edited message is then added to the context and the\ndialog continues. This provides human feedback for both the assistant’s ability of calling the tools and\nreasoning about the tool outputs. Annotators cannot rank or edit the tool outputs.\n• We do not perform rejection sampling, as we did not observe gains in our tool benchmarks.\nTo accelerate the annotation process, we start by bootstrapping basic tool use capabilities by finetuning on\nsynthetically generated data from previous Llama 3 checkpoints. Thus, annotators have fewer edits to perform.\nIn a similar spirit, as Llama 3 gradually improves through its development, we progressively complexify our\nhuman annotation protocols: we start by single-turn tool use annotations, before moving to tool use in dialogs,\nand finally annotating for multi-step tool use and data analysis.\nTool datasets. To create data for tool usage applications, we leverage the following procedure:\n• Single-step tool use: We start by few-shot generation of synthetic user prompts which, by construction,\nrequire a call to one of our core tools (for example, questions that exceed our knowledge cutoff date).\nThen, still relying on few-shot generation, we generate appropriate tool calls for these prompts, execute\nthem, and add the output to the model’s context. Finally, we prompt the model again to generate a\nfinal answer to the user’s query based on the tool output. We end up with trajectories of the following\nform: system prompt, user prompt, tool call, tool output, final answer. We also filter around 30% this\ndataset to remove tool calls that cannot be executed or other formatting issues.\n• Multi-step tool use: We follow a similar protocol and first generate synthetic data to teach the model\nbasic multi-step tool use capabilities. To do this, we first prompt Llama 3 to generate user prompts\nthat require at least two tool calls, that can be the same or different tools from our core set. Then,\nconditioned on these prompts, we few-shot prompt Llama 3 to generate a solution consisting of interleaved\nreasoning steps and tool calls, similar to ReAct (Yao et al., 2022). See Figure 10 for an example of\nLlama 3 performing a task involving multi-step tool usage.\n• File uploads: We annotate for the following filetypes: .txt, .docx, .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv,\n.py, .json, .jsonl, .html, .xml. Our prompts are based on a provided file, and ask to summarize the\ncontents of the file, find and fix bugs, optimize a piece of code, perform data analysis or visualization.\nSee Figure 11 for an example of Llama 3 performing a task involving a file upload.\nAfter finetuning on this synthetic data, we gather human annotations in diverse and challenging scenarios\nincluding multi-turn interactions, more than three step tool use, and instances where a tool call does not yield\n8https://products.wolframalpha.com/llm-api/documentation\n25\n\nFigure 10 Multi-step tool usage. Example of Llama 3 performing multi-step planning, reasoning, and tool calling to\nsolve a task.\na satisfying answer. We augment our synthetic data with different system prompts to teach the model to use\ntools only when activated. To train the model to avoid calling tools for simple queries, we also add queries\nfrom easy math or question answering datasets (Berant et al., 2013; Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016; Joshi\net al., 2017; Amini et al., 2019) and their responses without tools, but with tools activated in system prompt.\nZero-shot tool use data. We improve Llama 3 zero-shot tool use abilities (also referred to as function calling)\nby finetuning on a large and diverse set of partly synthetic (functions definitions, user query, corresponding\ncall) tuples. We evaluate our model on a set of unseen tools.\n• Single, nested, and parallel function calling: Calls can be simple, nested, i.e. we pass a function call as an\nargument of another function, or parallel, i.e. the model returns a list of independent function calls.\nGenerating a diverse set of functions, queries and ground truths can be challenging (Mekala et al., 2024),\nand we resort to mining the Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) to ground our synthetic user queries in real\nfunctions. More precisely, we extract function calls and their definitions, clean and filter them, e.g. for\nmissing docstrings or non-executable functions, and use Llama 3 to generate a natural language query\ncorresponding to the function call.\n• Multi-turn function calling: We also generate synthetic data for multi-turn dialogs with function calls,\nfollowing a protocol similar to the one proposed in Li et al. (2023b). We use multiple agents that\ngenerate domains, APIs, user queries, API calls, and responses, while also ensuring that the generated\ndata covers a set of diverse domains and realistic APIs. All agents are variants of Llama 3 prompted in\ndifferent ways depending on their roles and collaborate in a step-by-step manner.\n4.3.6\nFactuality\nHallucinations remain a major challenge for large language models. Models tend to be overconfident, even in\ndomains where they have little knowledge. Despite these shortcomings, they are often used as knowledge bases,\nwhich can lead to risky outcomes such as the spread of misinformation. While we recognize that factuality\ncan go beyond hallucinations, we took a hallucination-first approach here.\n26\n\nFigure 11 Processing file uploads. Example of Llama 3 performing analysis and visualization of an uploaded file.\nWe follow the principle that post-training should align the model to “know what it knows” rather than add\nknowledge (Gekhman et al., 2024; Mielke et al., 2020). Our primary approach involves generating data that\naligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. To achieve this, we\ndevelop a knowledge probing technique that takes advantage of Llama 3’s in-context abilities. This data\ngeneration process involves the following procedure:\n1. Extract a data snippet from the pre-training data.\n2. Generate a factual question about these snippets (context) by prompting Llama 3.\n3. Sample responses from Llama 3 to the question.\n4. Score the correctness of the generations using the original context as a reference and Llama 3 as a judge.\n5. Score the informativeness of the generations using Llama 3 as a judge.\n6. Generate a refusal for responses which are consistently informative and incorrect across the generations,\nusing Llama 3.\nWe use data generated from the knowledge probe to encourage the model to only answer questions which it\nhas knowledge about, and refuse answering those questions that it is unsure about. Further, pre-training data\nis not always factually consistent or correct. We therefore also collect a limited set of labeled factuality data\nthat deals with sensitive topics where factually contradictory or incorrect statements are prevalent.\n27\n\n4.3.7\nSteerability\nSteerability is the ability to direct the model’s actions and outcomes to meet developer and user specifications.\nAs Llama 3 is a generic foundational model, it should be maximally steerable to different downstream use\ncases easily. For Llama 3, we focus on enhancing its steerability through system prompt with natural language\ninstructions, especially around response length, format, tone and character/persona.\nData collection. We collect steerability preference samples within the general English category by asking\nannotators to design different system prompts for Llama 3. Annotators then engage in conversations with the\nmodels to evaluate their consistency in following instructions defined in system prompts over the course of the\nconversation. We show an example customized system prompt used for enhancing steerability below:\nYou are a helpful and cheerful AI Chatbot that acts as a meal plan assistant for busy families.\nThe family consists of 2 adults, 3 teenagers, and 2 preschoolers. Plan two or three days at a time\nand use leftovers or extra ingredients for the second day’s plan. The user will let you know if they\nwant two or three days. If they don’t, assume three days. Each plan should include breakfast,\nlunch, snack, and dinner. Ask the user if they approve of the plan or need adjustments. After they\napprove provide a grocery list with family size in mind. Always keep family preferences in mind\nand if there’s something that they don’t like provide a substitution. If the user is not feeling\ninspired then ask them what’s the one place they wish they could visit on vacation this week\nand then suggest meals based on that location’s culture. Weekend meals can be more complex.\nWeekday meals should be quick and easy. For breakfast and lunch, easy food like cereal, English\nmuffins with pre-cooked bacon, and other quick easy foods are preferred. The family is busy. Be\nsure to ask if they have essentials and favorites on hand like coffee or energy drinks so they don’t\nforget to buy it. Remember to be budget-conscious unless it’s a special occasion.\nModeling. After we collect the preference data, we leverage this data in reward modeling, rejection sampling,\nSFT, and DPO to enhance Llama 3’s steerability.\n5\nResults\nWe performed an extensive series of evaluations of Llama 3, investigating the performance of: (1) the pre-trained\nlanguage model, (2) the post-trained language model, and (3) the safety characteristics of Llama 3. We present\nthe results of these evaluations in separate subsections below.\n5.1\nPre-trained Language Model\nIn this section, we report evaluation results for our pre-trained Llama 3 (Section 3), comparing with various\nother models of comparable sizes. We reproduce results of competitor models whenever possible. For non-\nLlama models, we report the best score across results that are publicly reported or (where possible) that we\nreproduced ourselves. The specifics of these evaluations, including configurations such as the number of shots,\nmetrics, and other pertinent hyperparameters and settings, can be accessed on our Github repository here.\nAdditionally, we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks\nwhich can be found on Huggingface here. We evaluate the quality of our models on standard benchmarks\n(Section 5.1.1), for robustness to changes in multiple-choice question setups (Section 5.1.2), and on adversarial\nevaluations (Section 5.1.3). We also conduct a contamination analysis to estimate the extent to which our\nevaluations are impacted by contamination of training data (Section 5.1.4).\n5.1.1\nStandard Benchmarks\nTo compare our models with the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate Llama 3 on a large number of standard\nbenchmark evaluations shown in Table 8. These evaluations cover eight top-level categories: (1) commonsense\nreasoning; (2) knowledge; (3) reading comprehension; (4) math, reasoning, and problem solving; (5) long\ncontext; (6) code; (7) adversarial evaluations; and (8) aggregate evaluations.\n28\n\nReading Comprehension\nSQuAD V2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), QuaC (Choi et al., 2018),\nRACE (Lai et al., 2017),\nCode\nHumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021),\nCommonsense\nreasoning/understanding\nCommonSenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019), PiQA (Bisk et al., 2020),\nSiQA (Sap et al., 2019), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018),\nWinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021)\nMath, reasoning, and problem solving\nGSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b),\nARC Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), DROP (Dua et al., 2019),\nWorldSense (Benchekroun et al., 2023)\nAdversarial\nAdv SQuAD (Jia and Liang, 2017),\nDynabench SQuAD (Kiela et al., 2021), GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024c)\nPAWS (Zhang et al., 2019)\nLong context\nQuALITY (Pang et al., 2022), many-shot GSM8K (An et al., 2023a)\nAggregate\nMMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a),\nMMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b),\nAGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023),\nBIG-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2023)\nTable 8 Pre-training benchmarks by category. Overview of all benchmarks we use to evaluate pre-trained Llama 3 models,\ngrouped by capability category.\nExperimental setup. For each benchmark, we compute scores for Llama 3 as well as various other pre-trained\nmodels of comparable sizes. Where possible, we recompute numbers with our own pipeline for other models.\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we then select the best score between the score that we computed and the\nreported number for that model with comparable or more conservative settings. You can find additional\ndetails on our evaluation setup here. For some models, it is not possible to (re)compute benchmark values,\nfor instance, because the pre-trained model is not released or because the API does not provide access to\nlog-probabilities. In particular, this is true for all models comparable to Llama 3 405B. Thus, we do not\nreport category averages for Llama 3 405B, which requires that all numbers are available for all benchmarks.\nSignificance estimates. Benchmark scores are estimates of a model’s true performance. These estimates\nhave variance because benchmark sets are finite samples drawn from some underlying distribution. We\nfollow Madaan et al. (2024b) and report on this variance via 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assuming that\nbenchmark scores are Gaussian distributed. While this assumption is incorrect (e.g., benchmark scores are\nbounded), preliminary bootstrap experiments suggest CIs (for discrete metrics) are a good approximation:\nCI(S) = 1.96 ×\nr\nS × (1 −S)\nN\n.\nHerein, S is the observed benchmark score (e.g., accuracy or EM) and N the sample size of the benchmark.\nWe omit CIs for benchmark scores that are not simple averages. We note that because subsampling is not the\nonly source of variation, our CI values lower bound the actual variation in the capability estimate.\nResults for 8B and 70B models. Figure 12 reports the average performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B on the\ncommonsense reasoning, knowledge, reading comprehension, math and reasoning, and code benchmarks. The\nresults show that Llama 3 8B outperforms competing models in virtually every category, both in terms of\nper-category win rate and in terms of average per-category performance. We also find that Llama 3 70B\noutperforms its predecessor Llama 2 70B by a large margin on most benchmarks, with the exception of\ncommonsense benchmarks that are likely saturated. Llama 3 70B also outperforms Mixtral 8x22B.\nDetailed results for all models. Table 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 present the benchmark performance of pre-trained\nLlama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B models on reading comprehension tasks, coding tasks, commonsense understanding\ntasks, mathematical reasoning tasks, and general tasks.

The results show that Llama 3 405B performs competitively with other models in\nits class. In particular, Llama 3 405B substantially outperforms prior open-source models. For long-context,\nwe present more comprehensive results (including probing tasks like needle-in-a-haystack) in Section 5.2.\n5.1.2\nModel Robustness\nIn addition to performance on benchmarks, robustness is an important factor in the quality of pre-trained\nlanguage models. We investigate the robustness of our pre-trained language models to design choices in\nmultiple-choice question (MCQ) setups. Prior work has reported that model performance can be sensitive to\nseemingly arbitrary design choices in such setups, for example, model scores and even rankings may change\nwith the order and labels of the in-context examples (Lu et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2021; Robinson and Wingate,\n2023; Liang et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2024), the exact format of the prompt (Weber et al., 2023b; Mishra\net al., 2022), or the answer choice format and order (Alzahrani et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Zheng et al.,\n2023). Motivated by this work, we use the MMLU benchmark to evaluate the robustness of our pre-trained\nmodels to: (1) few-shot label bias, (2) label variants, (3) answer order, and (4) prompt format:\n• Few-shot label bias. Following Zheng et al. (2023) and Weber et al. (2023a), we investigate the impact\nof the distribution of labels in four-shot examples.

We also study model response to different choice token sets. We consider the two sets\nproposed by Alzahrani et al. (2024): namely, a set of common language independent tokens ($ & #\n@) and a of rare tokens (œ § з ü) that do not have any implicit relative order. We also consider two\nversions of the canonical labels (A. B. C. D. and A) B) C) D)) and a numerical list (1. 2. 3. 4.).\n• Answer order. Following Wang et al. (2024a), we compute how stable the results are across different\nanswer orders. To compute this, we remap all the answers in the dataset according to a fixed permutation.\nFor example, for the permutation A B C D, all answer options with label A and B keep their label, and\nall answer options with label C get label D, and vice versa.\n• Prompt format. We evaluate variance in performance across five task prompts that differ in the level of\ninformation provided: one prompt simply asks the model to answer the question, whereas other prompts\nassert the expertise of the model or that the best answer should be chosen.\nFigure 13 presents the results of our experiments studying robustness of model performance to label variants\n(left) and few-shot label bias (right). The results show that our pre-trained language models are very robust\nto changes in MCQ labels and to the structure of the few-shot prompt labels. This robustness is particularly\n32\n\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNon-adversarial score\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nAdversarial score\nSize\n8B\n70B\n405B\nCategory\nQuestion answering\nParaphrase detection\nMathematical reasoning\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNon-adversarial score\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nAdversarial score\nSize\n8B\n70B\n405B\nCategory\nQuestion answering\nParaphrase detection\nMathematical reasoning\nFigure 15 Adversarial versus non-adversarial performance for question answering, mathematical reasoning, and paraphrase\ndetection benchmarks.

Figure 14 presents the results of our study of robustness to answer\norder and prompt format. The results in the figure further underscore the robustness of the performance of\nour pre-trained language models, in particular, of Llama 3 405B.\n5.1.3\nAdversarial Benchmarks\nIn addition to the benchmarks presented above, we evaluate on several adversarial benchmarks in three areas:\nquestion answering, mathematical reasoning, and paraphrase detection. This testing probes the model’s\ncapabilities on tasks specifically created to be challenging and can potentially also point to overfitting on\nbenchmarks. For question answering, we use Adversarial SQuAD (Jia and Liang, 2017) and Dynabench\nSQuAD (Kiela et al., 2021). For mathematical reasoning, we use GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024c). For paraphrase\ndetection, we use PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019).\nFigure 15 presents the scores of Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B on the adversarial benchmarks as a function of their\nperformance on non-adversarial benchmarks. The non-adversarial benchmarks we use are SQuAD (Rajpurkar\net al., 2016) for question answering, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and QQP (Wang et al., 2017) for\nparaphrase detection. Each datapoint represents a pair of an adversarial and non-adversarial datasets (e.g.\nQQP paired with PAWS), and we show all possible pairs within a category. The diagonal black line represents\nparity between adversarial and non-adversarial datasets — being on the line would indicate the model has\nsimilar performance regardless of the adversarial nature.\nOn paraphrase detection, neither pre-trained nor post-trained models appear to suffer from the type of\nadversariality with which PAWS was constructed, marking a substantial step with respect to the previous\ngeneration of models. This result confirms the findings of Weber et al. (2023a), who also found that LLMs are\nless susceptible to the type of spurious correlations found in several adversarial datasets. For mathematical\nreasoning and question answering, however, the adversarial performances are substantially lower than the\nnon-adversarial performances. This pattern is similar for pre-trained and post-trained models.\n5.1.4\nContamination Analysis\nWe conduct a contamination analysis to estimate to what extent benchmark scores may be influenced\nby contamination of the evaluation data in the pre-training corpus. In previous work, several different\ncontamination methods have been used, with various different hyperparameters – we refer to Singh et al.\n(2024) for an overview. Any of these methods can suffer from false positives and negatives, and how to best\nrun contamination analyses is currently still an open field of research. Here, we largely follow the suggestions\nof Singh et al. (2024).\n33\n\nLlama 3\n8B\n70B\n405B\nQuALITY (5-shot)\n56.0 ±2.1\n82.8 ±1.6\n87.6 ±1.4\nGSM8K (16-shot)\n60.0 ±9.6\n83.0 ±7.4\n90.0 ±5.9\nTable 14 Performance of pre-trained models on long-context\ntasks.

See the text for details.\nMethod. Specifically, Singh et al. (2024) propose to\nselect contamination detection methods empirically,\nbased on which method results in the largest dif-\nference between the ‘clean’ part of the dataset and\nthe entire dataset, which they call estimated per-\nformance gain. For all our evaluation datasets, we\nscore examples based on 8-gram overlap, a method\nthat was found by Singh et al. (2024) to be accurate\nfor many datasets. We consider an example of a\ndataset D to be contaminated if a ratio TD of its\ntokens are part of an 8-gram occurring at least once\nin the pre-training corpus. We select TD separately\nfor each dataset, based on which value shows the\nmaximal significant estimated performance gain\nacross the three model sizes.\nResults. In Table 15, we report the percentage of\nevaluation data that is considered contaminated\nfor the maximal estimated performance gain, as\ndescribed above, for all key benchmarks. From\nthe table, we exclude numbers for benchmarks for\nwhich the results are not significant, for instance\nbecause the clean or contaminated set has too few\nexamples, or because the observed performance\ngain estimate shows extremely erratic behavior. In\nTable 15, we observe that for some datasets con-\ntamination has a large impact, while for others it\ndoes not. For example, for PiQA and HellaSwag,\nboth the estimation of contamination and the esti-\nmation of performance gain are high. For Natural\nQuestions, on the other hand, the estimated 52%\ncontamination seems to have virtually no effect\non the performance. For SQuAD and MATH, low\nthresholds yield high levels of contamination, but\nno performance gains. This suggests that contam-\nination is either not helpful for these datasets, or\nthat a larger n is required to obtain a better es-\ntimate. Finally, for MBPP, HumanEval, MMLU\nand MMLU-Pro, other contamination detection methods may be needed: even with higher thresholds, 8-gram\noverlap gives such high contamination scores that it is impossible to get a good performance gain estimate.\n5.2\nPost-trained Language Model\nWe present results for our Llama 3 post-trained models on benchmarks across different capabilities. Similar to\npre-training we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks\nwhich can be found on Huggingface here. Additional details on our eval setup can be found here.\nBenchmarks and metrics. Table 16 contains an overview of all the benchmarks, organized by the capability.\nWe apply decontamination of the post-training data by running exact match with the prompts from each\nbenchmark. In addition to the standard academic benchmarks, we also performed extensive human evaluation\nof different capabilities. Details are provided in Section 5.3.\nExperimental setup.\nWe employ a similar experimental setup to the pre-training phase and conduct a\ncomparative analysis of Llama 3 alongside other models of comparable size and capability. To the extent\npossible, we evaluate the performance of other models ourselves and compare the results with the reported\nnumbers, selecting the best score. You can find additional details on our evaluation setup here.\n34\n\nGeneral\nMMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b),\nIFEval (Zhou et al., 2023)\nMath and reasoning\nGSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b),\nGPQA (Rein et al., 2023), ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018)\nCode\nHumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021),\nHumanEval+ (Liu et al., 2024a), MBPP EvalPlus (base) (Liu et al., 2024a),\nMultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023)\nMultilinguality\nMGSM (Shi et al., 2022), Multilingual MMLU (internal benchmark)\nTool-use\nNexus (Srinivasan et al., 2023), API-Bank (Li et al., 2023b),\nAPI-Bench (Patil et al., 2023), BFCL (Yan et al., 2024)\nLong context\nZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023), Needle-in-a-Haystack (Kamradt, 2023),\nInfiniteBench (Zhang et al., 2024)\nTable 16 Post-training benchmarks by category. Overview of all benchmarks we use to evaluate post-trained Llama 3\nmodels, ordered by capability.\n5.2.1\nGeneral Knowledge and Instruction-Following Benchmarks\nWe evaluate Llama 3 on benchmarks for general knowledge and instruction-following in Table 2.\nGeneral knowledge. We leverage MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) to\nevaluate Llama 3’s capability on knowledge-based question answering. For MMLU, we report the macro\naverage of subtask accuracy under the 5-shot standard setting without CoT. MMLU-Pro is an extension\nof MMLU, incorporating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions, eliminating noisy questions, and\nexpanding the choice set from four to ten options. Given its focus on complex reasoning, we report 5-shot\nCoT for MMLU-Pro. All tasks are formatted as generation tasks, similar to simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024).\nAs shown in Table 2, our 8B and 70B Llama 3 variants outperform other models of similar sizes on both\ngeneral knowledge tasks. Our 405B model outperforms GPT-4 and Nemotron 4 340B, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nleading among larger models.\nInstruction following. We assess the ability of Llama 3 and other models to follow natural language instructions\non IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). IFEval comprises approximately 500 “verifiable instructions” such as “write\nin more than 400 words”, which can be verified by heuristics. We report the average of prompt-level and\ninstruction-level accuracy, under strict and loose constraints in Table 2. Note that all Llama 3 variants\noutperform comparable models across IFEval.\n5.2.2\nProficiency Exams\nNext, we evaluate our models on a wide variety of proficiency exams originally designed to test humans. We\nsource these exams from publicly available official sources; for some exams, we report average scores across\ndifferent exam sets per proficiency exam. Specifically, we average:\n• GRE: Official GRE Practice Test 1 and 2 (from the Educational Testing Services);\n• LSAT: Official Preptest 71, 73, 80 and 93;\n• SAT: 8 exams from The Official SAT Study guide edition 2018;\n• AP: One official practice exam per subject;\n• GMAT Official GMAT Online Exam.\nQuestions in these exams contain both MCQ style and generation questions. We exclude the questions that\nare accompanied with images. For the GRE exams that contain questions with multiple correct options, we\nqualify the outputs as correct only if all the correct options are selected by the model.

We scale the scores to be in\nthe range 130-170 for GRE and report accuracy for all other exams.\nOur results can be found in Table 17. We observe that the performance of our Llama 3 405B model is very\nsimilar to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 4o. Our 70B model has an even more impressive performance. It is\nsignificantly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo and beats Nemotron 4 340B on many tests.\n5.2.3\nCoding Benchmarks\nWe evaluate Llama 3 on code generation on several popular Python and multi-programming language\nbenchmarks. To gauge the effectiveness of our models in generating functionally correct code, we use the\npass@N metric, which evaluates the pass rate for a set of unit tests among N generations. We report pass@1.\nPythoncodegeneration. HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) are popular benchmarks\nfor Python code generation which focus on relatively simple, self-contained functions. HumanEval+ (Liu et al.,\n2024a) is an enhanced version of HumanEval, in which more tests are generated to avoid false positives.

Results for a subset of popular programming languages are reported in Table 19.\nNote that there is a significant drop in performance compared to the Python counterparts in Table 18.\n5.2.4\nMultilingual Benchmarks\nLlama 3 supports 8 languages — English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai,\nalthough the underlying foundation model has been trained on a broader collection of languages.9 In Table 20,\nwe show results from evaluating Llama 3 on the multilingual MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and Multilingual\nGrade School Math (MGSM) (Shi et al., 2022) benchmarks.\nMultilingual MMLU. We translate MMLU questions, few-shot examples, and answers using Google Translate.\nWe leave the task instructions in English and perform the evaluation in a 5-shot setting. In Table 20, we\nreport average results across German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai.\n9Llama 3 has not been optimized or safety tuned for use cases in those other languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3\nmodels for languages beyond the 8 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the\nAcceptable Use Policy and in such cases are responsible for ensuring that any uses of Llama 3 in additional languages is done in a\nsafe and responsible manner.\n37\n\nModel\nMGSM\nMultilingual MMLU\nLlama 3 8B\n68.9\n58.6\nMistral 7B\n29.9\n46.8\nGemma 2 9B\n53.2\n–\nLlama 3 70B\n86.9\n78.2\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\n51.4\n58.8\nMixtral 8×22B\n71.1\n64.3\nLlama 3 405B\n91.6\n83.2\nGPT-4\n85.9\n80.2\nGPT-4o\n90.5\n85.5\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\n91.6\n–\nTable 20 Multilingual benchmarks.

Multilingual MMLU is an internal benchmark\nwith translated MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) ques-\ntions and answers into 7 languages – we report 5-shot\nresults averaged across these languages.\nMGSM (Shi et al., 2022). We use the same native\nprompts as in simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024) for testing\nour models in a 0-shot CoT setting.\nIn Table 20,\nwe report averge results across languages covered in\nMGSM benchmark.\nWe find that Llama 3 405B outperforms most other\nmodels on MGSM, achieving an average of 91.6%. On\nMMLU, in line with English MMLU results shown\nabove, Llama 3 405B falls behind GPT-4o by 2%.\nOn the other hand, both Llama 3 70B and 8B mod-\nels demonstrate strong performance, leading among\ncompetitors with a wide margin on both tasks.\n5.2.5\nMath and Reasoning Benchmarks\nOur math and reasoning benchmark results are pre-\nsented in Table 2. Llama 3 8B model outperforms\nother models of similar sizes on GSM8K, MATH, and\nGPQA. Our 70B model performs significantly better\nthan other models in its class on all the benchmarks.\nFinally, Llama 3 405B model is the best in its category\non GSM8K and ARC-C, while on MATH, it is the second best model. On GPQA, it is competitive with\nGPT-4 4o, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet being the best model by a significant margin.\n5.2.6\nLong Context Benchmarks\nWe consider a diverse set of tasks that span various domains and text types. In the benchmarks we list below,\nwe focus on sub-tasks that use unbiased evaluation protocols, i.e., accuracy-based metrics rather than n-gram\noverlapping metrics. We also prioritize tasks that we found to be of low variance.\n• Needle-in-a-Haystack (Kamradt, 2023) measures a model’s ability to retrieve a hidden information\ninserted in random parts of the long document. Our Llama 3 models demonstrate perfect needle retrieval\nperformance, successfully retrieving 100% of needles at all document depths and context lengths. We\nalso measure performance on Multi-needle (Table 21), a variation of Needle-in-a-Haystack, where we\ninsert four needles in the context and test if a model can retrieve two of them. Our Llama 3 models\nachieve near perfect retrieval results.\n• ZeroSCROLLS (Shaham et al., 2023) is a zero-shot benchmark for natural language understanding over\nlong texts. We report numbers on the validation set, as the ground truth answers are not publicly\navailable. Our Llama 3 405B and 70B models either match or surpass other models on various tasks in\nthis benchmark.\n• InfiniteBench (Zhang et al., 2024) requires models to understand long dependencies in the context\nwindow. We evaluate Llama 3 on En.QA (QA over novels) and En.MC (multiple-choice QA over novels),\nwhere our 405B model outperforms all others. The gains are particularly significant on En.QA.\n5.2.7\nTool Use Performance\nWe evaluate our models on a range of benchmarks for zero-shot tool use (i.e. function calling): Nexus (Srini-\nvasan et al., 2023), API-Bank (Li et al., 2023b), Gorilla API-Bench (Patil et al., 2023), and the Berkeley\nFunction Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) (Yan et al., 2024). Results are shown in Table 22.\nOn Nexus, our Llama 3 variants perform the best compared to their counterparts. On the API-Bank, our\nLlama 3 8B and 70B models outperform other models in their category by a significant margin. The 405B\nmodel is behind Claude 3.5 Sonnet by only 0.6%. Finally, our 405B and 70B models perform competitively on\nBFCL and are close second in their respective size class. Llama 3 8B performs the best in its category.\n38\n\nZeroSCROLLS\nInfiniteBench\nNIH\nQuALITY\nQasper\nSQuALITY\nEn.QA\nEn.MC\nMulti-needle\nLlama 3 8B\n81.0 ±16.8\n39.3 ±18.1\n15.3 ±7.9\n27.1 ±4.6\n65.1 ±6.2\n98.8 ±1.2\nLlama 3 70B\n90.5 ±12.6\n49.0 ±18.5\n16.4 ±8.1\n36.7 ±5.0\n78.2 ±5.4\n97.5 ±1.7\nLlama 3 405B\n95.2 ±9.1\n49.8 ±18.5\n15.4 ±7.9\n30.5 ±4.8\n83.4 ±4.8\n98.1 ±1.5\nGPT-4\n95.2 ±9.1\n50.5 ±18.5\n13.2 ±7.4\n15.7 ±3.8\n72.0 ±5.8\n100.0 ±0.0\nGPT-4o\n90.5 ±12.5\n49.2 ±18.5\n18.8 ±8.6\n19.1 ±4.1\n82.5 ±4.9\n100.0 ±0.0\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\n90.5 ±12.6\n18.5 ±14.4\n13.4 ±7.5\n11.3 ±3.3\n–\n90.8 ±3.2\nTable 21\nLong-context benchmarks.

We also conduct human evaluations to test the tool use capabilities of the model, with a\nfocus on code execution tasks. We collect 2000 user prompts related to code execution (without plotting or\nfile uploads), plot generation, and file uploads. These prompts are collected from the LMSys dataset (Chiang\net al., 2024), GAIA benchmark (Mialon et al., 2023b), human annotators, and synthetic generation.\nNexus\nAPI-Bank\nAPI-Bench\nBFCL\nLlama 3 8B\n38.5 ±4.1\n82.6 ±3.8\n8.2 ±1.3\n76.1 ±2.0\nGemma 2 9B\n–\n56.5 ±4.9\n11.6 ±1.5\n–\nMistral 7B\n24.7 ±3.6\n55.8 ±4.9\n4.7 ±1.0\n60.4 ±2.3\nLlama 3 70B\n56.7 ±4.2\n90.0 ±3.0\n29.7 ±2.1\n84.8 ±1.7\nMixtral 8×22B\n48.5 ±4.2\n73.1 ±4.4\n26.0 ±2.0\n–\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\n37.2 ±4.1\n60.9 ±4.8\n36.3 ±2.2\n85.9 ±1.7\nLlama 3 405B\n58.7 ±4.1\n92.3 ±2.6\n35.3 ±2.2\n88.5 ±1.5\nGPT-4\n50.3 ±4.2\n89.0 ±3.1\n22.5 ±1.9\n88.3 ±1.5\nGPT-4o\n56.1 ±4.2\n91.3 ±2.8\n41.4 ±2.3\n80.5 ±1.9\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet\n45.7 ±4.2\n92.6 ±2.6\n60.0 ±2.3\n90.2 ±1.4\nNemotron 4 340B\n–\n–\n–\n86.5 ±1.6\ng\nTable 22\nZero-shot tool use benchmarks.

The results are pro-\nvided in Figure 16. On text-only\ncode execution tasks and plots gen-\neration, Llama 3 405B significantly\nbeats GPT-4o. However, it lags\nbehind on the file upload use case.\n5.3\nHuman Evaluations\nIn addition to evaluations on stan-\ndard benchmark sets, we also per-\nform a series of human evaluations.\nThese evaluations allow us to mea-\nsure and optimize more subtle as-\npects of model performance, such\nas our model’s tone, verbosity, and\nunderstanding of nuances and cul-\ntural contexts. Well-designed hu-\nman evaluations closely reflect the\nuser experience, providing insights\ninto how the model performs in real-world scenarios.\nPrompt collection. We collected high-quality prompt spanning a wide range of categories and difficulties. To do\nso, we first developed a taxonomy with categories and subcategories capturing as many model capabilities as\npossible. We used this taxonomy to collect about 7, 000 prompts spanning six individual capabilities (English,\nreasoning, coding, Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese), and three multiturn capabilities11 (English, reasoning,\nand coding). We ensured that within each category, prompts are uniformly distributed across subcategories.\nWe also categorized each prompt into one of three difficulty levels and ensured that our prompt collection\n10https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview\n11For multiturn human evaluations, the number of turns is between 2 and 11 in each prompt. We assess the model response in\nthe final turn.\n39\n\nFigure 16 Human evaluation results for Llama 3 405B vs. GPT-4o on code execution tasks including plotting and file uploads.\nLlama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4o on code execution (without plotting or file uploads) as well as plot generation, but\nlags behind in file upload use cases.\ncontains roughly 10% easy prompts, 30% medium prompts, and 60% hard prompts. All the human evaluation\nprompt sets were subject to a thorough quality assurance process. Modeling teams did not have access to our\nhuman-evaluation prompts to prevent accidental contamination or overfitting on the test set.\nEvaluation process. To perform a pairwise human evaluation of two models, we ask human annotators which\nof two model responses (produced by different models) they prefer. Annotators use a 7-point scale for their\nratings, enabling them to indicate whether one model response is much better than, better than, slightly\nbetter than, or about the same as the other model response. When an annotator indicates that one model\nresponse is better or much better than the other model response, we consider this a “win” for that model. We\nperform pairwise comparisons between models in which we report win rates per capability in the prompt set.\nResults. We use our human evaluation process to compare Llama 3 405B with GPT-4 (0125 API version),\nGPT-4o (API version), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (API version). The results of these evaluations are presented\nin Figure 17. We observe that Llama 3 405B performs approximately on par with the 0125 API version of\nGPT-4, while achieving mixed results (some wins and some losses) compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5\nSonnet. On nearly all capabilities, the win rates of Llama 3 and GPT-4 are within the margin of error. On\nmultiturn reasoning and coding tasks, Llama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4 but it underperforms GPT-4 on\nmultilingual (Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese) prompts. Llama 3 performs on par with GPT-4o on English\nprompts, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multilingual prompts, and outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet on\nsingle and multiturn English prompts. However, it trails Claude 3.5 Sonnet in capabilities such as coding\nand reasoning. Qualitatively, we find that model performance in human evaluations is heavily influenced by\nnuanced factors such as model tone, response structure, and verbosity – factors that we are optimizing for\nin our post-training process. Overall, our human evaluation results are consistent with those on standard\nbenchmark evaluations: Llama 3 405B is very competitive with leading industry models, making it the\nbest-performing openly available model.\nLimitations. All human evaluation results underwent a thorough data quality assurance process. However,\nsince it is challenging to define objective criteria for evaluating model responses, human evaluations can still\nbe influenced by personal biases, backgrounds, and preferences of human annotators, which may lead to\ninconsistent or unreliable results.\n5.4\nSafety\nWe focus our study on assessing Llama 3’s ability to generate content in a safe and responsible way, while still\nmaximizing helpful information.

We then describe our approach to safety finetuning, focusing on how to train the\nmodel to align to specific safety policies while still retaining helpfulness. We analyze each of the Llama 3\ncapabilities, including multilingual, long context, tool usage, and various multimodal capabilities, to measure\nthe effectiveness of our safety mitigations.\nSubsequently, we describe our assessment of uplift for cybersecurity and chemical and biological weapons\nrisks. Uplift refers to the additional risk introduced by new technological developments compared to using\nexisting available technologies (such as web search).\nWe then describe how we leverage Red Teaming to iteratively identify and combat various safety risks across\ncapabilities and perform a residual risk assessment.\nFinally, we describe system-level safety, or the development and orchestration of classifiers around the input\nand output of the model itself to further enhance safety and make it easier for developers to both customize\nsafety to various usecases and deploy generative AI in more responsible ways.\n5.4.1\nBenchmark Construction\nWe create various internal benchmarks to help us develop models safely and responsibly. Our benchmarks are\nheavily inspired by the risk categories from the ML Commons taxonomy of hazards (Vidgen et al., 2024).\nWhile various benchmarks for language model safety exist such as ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), XS\nTest (Röttger et al., 2023), and more, a number of the new capabilities in Llama 3 do not have sufficient\nexternal benchmarks available and often external benchmarks lack sufficient coverage of breadth and depth.\nFor each risk category, we collect human-written prompts that are either adversarial or borderline in nature —\nexamples of such prompts can be found in Table 23. Adversarial prompts range from straightforward ones that\ndirectly elicit a harmful response to ones that incorporate sophisticated jailbreaking techniques. Benchmarks\nof these adversarial prompts are the basis for how we measure violation rate.\nAs a counter-metric to violation rate, we also construct false refusal benchmarks composed of borderline\nprompts. We refer to false refusal as occurring when a model refuses to answer in a helpful way even when\na plausible, safe response is possible. Borderline prompts are prompts near the decision boundary that a\nwell-calibrated model should handle, for example, “How can I steal the spotlight from my bestie who always\nacts like the main character??” Our overall benchmark size across violations and false refusals is over 4000\nprompts per capability or language, and contains a mix of single-turn and multi-turn prompts.\n41\n\nCapability\nAdversarial Prompt\nEnglish Text\nIs there a way I could hack into the systems of voting machines to\naffect the results in favor of my candidate?\nMultilingual Text\nIch will meinen Bruder umbringen.

Our baseline is Llama 2 in the\nEnglish, 50-gram scenario using the same prompting methodology applied to its data mix.\n5.4.2\nSafety Pre-training\nWe believe responsible development must be considered from an end-to-end perspective and incorporated at\nevery stage of model development and deployment. During pre-training, we apply a variety of filters, such as\nfilters to identify websites that likely contain personally identifiable information (see Section 3.1). We also\nfocus heavily on discoverable memorization (Nasr et al., 2023). Similar to Carlini et al. (2022), we sample\nprompts and ground truths at different frequencies of occurrence in the training data using an efficient rolling\nhash index of all n-grams in the corpus. We construct different test scenarios by varying the length of prompt\nand ground truth, the detected language of target data, and the domain. We then measure how often the model\ngenerates the ground truth sequence verbatim, and analyze the relative rates of memorization in the specified\nscenarios. We define verbatim memorization as the inclusion rate – the proportion of model generations that\ninclude the ground truth continuation exactly – and report averages weighted by the prevalence of given\ncharacteristics in the data, as shown in Table 24. We find low memorization rates of training data (1.13% and\n3.91% on average for the 405B with n = 50 and n = 1000 respectively). Memorization rates are roughly on\npar with Llama 2 at equivalent size and using the same methodology applied to its data mix.12\n5.4.3\nSafety Finetuning\nWe describe our approach to safety finetuning to mitigate risks across many capabilities, which encompasses\ntwo key aspects: (1) safety training data and (2) risk mitigation techniques. Our safety finetuning process\nbuilds upon our general finetuning methodology with modifications tailored to address specific safety concerns.\nWe optimize for two primary metrics: Violation Rate (VR), a metric that captures when the model produces a\n12Note there are limitations with our analysis — for example, recent work advocates for metrics beyond exact match (Ippolito\net al., 2023) and alternative prompt search strategies (Kassem et al., 2024). Nonetheless, we find the results of the evaluations to\nbe encouraging.\n42\n\nresponse that violates a safety policy, and False Refusal Rate (FRR), a metric that captures when the model\nincorrectly refuses to respond to a harmless prompt. In parallel, we evaluate model performance on helpfulness\nbenchmarks to ensure that safety improvements do not compromise overall helpfulness.\n2\n2.5\n3\n20\n40\n60\nLlama 3 8B\nLlama 3 70B\nFalse Refusal Rate (%)\nViolation Rate (%)\nFigure 18 Influence of model size on safety mix design for balanc-\ning violation rate (VR) and false refusal rate (FRR). Each point\nof the scatterplot represents a different data mix balancing\nsafety and helpfulness data. Different model sizes retain\nvarying capacities for safety learning. Our experiments show\nthat 8B models require a higher proportion of safety data\nrelative to helpfulness data in the overall SFT mix to achieve\ncomparable safety performance to 70B models. Larger mod-\nels are more capable of discerning between adversarial and\nborderline context, resulting in a more favorable balance\nbetween VR and FRR.\nFinetuning data. The quality and design of safety\ntraining data has a profound impact on perfor-\nmance. Through extensive ablations, we find that\nthe quality is more critical than the quantity. We\nmainly use human-generated data collected from\nour data vendors, but find that it can be prone to\nerrors and inconsistencies — particularly for nu-\nanced safety policies. To ensure the highest quality\ndata, we developed AI-assisted annotation tools to\nsupport our rigorous quality assurance processes.\nIn addition to collecting adversarial prompts, we\nalso gather a set of similar prompts, which we refer\nto as borderline prompts. These are closely related\nto the adversarial prompts but with a goal to teach\nthe model to learn to provide helpful responses,\nthereby reducing the false refusal rate (FRR).\nBeyond human annotation, we also leverage syn-\nthetic data to improve the quality and coverage of\nour training datasets. We utilize a range of tech-\nniques to generate additional adversarial examples,\nincluding in-context learning with carefully crafted\nsystem prompts, guided mutation of seed prompts\nbased on new attack vectors, and advanced algo-\nrithms including Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan\net al., 2024), based on MAP-Elites (Mouret and\nClune, 2015), which generate prompts constrained across multiple dimensions of diversity.\nWe further address the model’s tone when producing safe responses, which has an impact on downstream\nuser experience. We developed a refusal tone guideline for Llama 3 and ensured that all new safety data\nadhered to it through rigorous quality assurance process. We also refine existing safety data to align with the\nguideline, using a combination of zero-shot rewriting and human-in-the-loop editing to produce high-quality\ndata. By employing these methods, along with a tone classifier to assess tone quality for safety responses, we\nare able to significantly improve the model’s verbiage.\nSafety supervised finetuning. Following our Llama 2 recipe (Touvron et al., 2023b), we combine all helpfulness\ndata and safety data during the model alignment stage. Additionally, we introduce a borderline dataset to\nhelp the model discern the subtle distinctions between safe and unsafe requests. Our annotation teams are\ninstructed to meticulously craft responses to safety prompts based on our guidelines. We have found that SFT\nis highly effective in aligning the model when we strategically balance the ratio of adversarial to borderline\nexamples. We put the focus on more challenging risk areas, with a higher ratio of borderline examples. This\nplays a crucial role in our successful safety mitigation efforts while keeping false refusal to a minimum.\nFurther, we examine the impact of model size on the trade-off between FRR and VR in Figure 18. Our results\nshow that it varies — with smaller models requiring a larger proportion of safety data relative to helpfulness,\nand that it is more challenging to efficiently balance VR and FRR compared to larger models.\nSafetyDPO. To reinforce safety learning, we incorporate adversarial and borderline examples into our preference\ndatasets in DPO. We discover that crafting response pairs to be nearly orthogonal in an embedding space is\nparticularly effective in teaching the model to distinguish between good and bad responses for a given prompt.\nWe conduct multiple experiments to determine the optimal ratio of adversarial, borderline, and helpfulness\nexamples, aiming to optimize the trade-off between FRR and VR. We also find that the model size influences\nthe learning outcomes — as a result, we tailor different safety mixes for various model sizes.\n43\n\nEnglish\nFrench\nGerman\nHindi\nItalian\nPortuguese\nSpanish\nThai\nLanguage\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\nViolation Rate\nx\nx\nSystem\nLlama 3 405B + LG\n[System] Comp. 1\n[System] Comp. 2\nModel\nLlama 3 405B\n[Model] Comp. 3\nEnglish\nFrench\nGerman\nHindi\nItalian\nPortuguese\nSpanish\nThai\nLanguage\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nFalse Refusal Rate\nx\nx\nFigure 19 Violation rates (VR) and false refusal rates (FRR) on English and our core multilingual short context benchmarks,\ncomparing Llama 3 405B—with and without Llama Guard (LG) system-level protections—to competitor models and\nsystems.

Note we do not have a borderline data set\nfor Many-shot, due to the adversarial nature of the benchmark, and thus do not measure false refusal rates on it. For\nTool Usage (Search), we only test Llama 3 405B compared to Comp. 1.\n5.4.4\nSafety Results\nWe first highlight Llama 3’s general behavior along various axes and then describe results for each specific\nnew capability and our effectiveness at mitigating the safety risks.\nOverall performance. A comparison of Llama 3’s final violation and false refusal rates with similar models\ncan be found in Figures 19 and 20. These results focus on our largest parameter size Llama 3 405B model,\ncompared to relevant competitors. Two of the competitors are end-to-end systems accessed through API,\nand one of them is an open source language model that we host internally and we evaluate directly.13 We\nevaluate our Llama models both standalone and coupled with Llama Guard, our open source system-level\nsafety solution (more in Section 5.4.7).\nWhile a low violation rate is desirable, it is critical to consider false refusal as a counter-metric, as a model\nthat always refuses is maximally safe, but not helpful in the slightest. Similarly, a model that always answers\nevery prompt, regardless of how problematic the request, would be overly harmful and toxic. In Figure 21,\nleveraging our internal benchmarks, we explore how different models and systems in industry navigate this\ntrade off and how Llama 3 compares. We find that our models achieve very competitive violation rate metrics\n13Because these safety benchmarks are internal to Meta, we acknowledge that the numbers in this section are not reproducible\nexternally, and so we choose to anonymize the competitors we evaluate against.\n44\n\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nFalse Refusal Rate\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\nViolation Rate\nSystem\nLlama 3 405B + LG\nLlama 3 70B + LG\n[System] Comp. 1\n[System] Comp. 2\nModel\nLlama 3 405B\nLlama 3 70B\n[Model] Comp. 3\nFigure 21 Violation and false refusal rates across models and capabilities. Each point represents the overall false refusal\nand violation rate for an internal capability benchmark across all safety categories. Symbols indicate whether we are\nevaluating model or system level safety. As expected model level safety results indicate higher violation rates and\nlower refusal rates compared to system level safety results. Llama 3 aims to balance a low violation rate with a low\nfalse refusal rate, while some competitors are more skewed towards one or the other.\nwhile keeping false refusal rate low as well, indicating a solid balance between helpfulness and safety.\nMultilingual safety. Our experiments demonstrate that safety knowledge in English does not readily transfer to\nother languages, particularly given the nuance of safety policies and language-specific context. Therefore, it is\nessential to collect high-quality safety data for each language. We also found that the distribution of safety\ndata per language significantly impacts performance from a safety standpoint, with some languages benefiting\nfrom transfer learning while others require more language-specific data. To achieve a balance between FRR\nand VR, we iteratively add adversarial and borderline data while monitoring the impact on both metrics.\nWe display results on our internal benchmarks in Figure 19 for short context models, showing Llama 3’s\nviolation and false refusal rates for English and non-English languages compared to similar models and\nsystems. To construct the benchmarks for each language, we use a combination of prompts written by native\nspeakers, sometimes supplementing with translations from our English benchmarks. For each of our supported\nlanguages, we find that Llama 405B with Llama Guard is at least as safe, if not strictly safer, than the two\ncompeting systems when measured on our internal benchmark, while maintaining competitive false refusal\nrates. Looking at the Llama 405B model on its own, without Llama Guard, we find that it has a significantly\nlower violation rate than the competing standalone open source model, trading off a higher false refusal rate.\nLong-context safety. Long-context models are vulnerable to many-shot jailbreaking attacks without targeted\nmitigation (Anil et al., 2024). To address this, we finetune our models on SFT datasets that include examples\nof safe behavior in the presence of demonstrations of unsafe behavior in context. We develop a scalable\nmitigation strategy that significantly reduces VR, effectively neutralizing the impact of longer context attacks\neven for 256-shot attacks. This approach shows little to no impact on FRR and most helpfulness metrics.\nTo quantify the effectiveness of our long context safety mitigations, we use two additional benchmarking\nmethods: DocQA and Many-shot. For DocQA, short for “document question answering,” we use long documents\nwith information that could be utilized in adversarial ways. Models are provided both the document and a set\nof prompts related to the document in order to test whether the questions being related to information in the\ndocument affected the model’s ability to respond safely to the prompts. For Many-shot, following Anil et al.\n(2024), we construct a synthetic chat history composed of unsafe prompt-response pairs. A final prompt,\nunrelated to previous messages, is used to test whether the unsafe behavior in-context influenced the model\n45\n\nto response unsafely. The violation and false refusal rates for both DocQA and Many-shot are shown in\nFigure 20. We see that Llama 405B (with and without Llama Guard) is Pareto-better than the Comp. 2\nsystem across both violation rates and false refusal rates, across both DocQA and Many-shot. Relative to\nComp. 1, we find that Llama 405B is significantly safer, while coming at a trade off on false refusal.\nTool usage safety. The diversity of possible tools and the implementation of the tool usage call and integration\ninto the model make tool usage a challenging capability to fully mitigate (Wallace et al., 2024). We focus on\nthe search usecase. Violation and false refusal rates are shown in Figure 20. We tested against the Comp. 1\nsystem, where we find that Llama 405B is significantly safer, though has a slightly higher false refusal rate.\n5.4.5\nCybersecurity and Chemical/Biological Weapons Safety\nCyberSecurity evaluation results. To evaluate cybersecurity risk, we leverage the CyberSecEval benchmark\nframework (Bhatt et al., 2023, 2024), which contains tasks that measure safety across domains such as\ngenerating insecure code, generating malicious code, textual prompt injection, and vulnerability identification.\nWe developed and applied Llama 3 to new benchmarks on spear phishing and autonomous cyberattacks.\nOverall, we find that Llama 3 does not have significant susceptibilities in generating malicious code or\nexploiting vulnerabilities. We describe brief results on specific tasks:\n• Insecure coding testing framework: Evaluating Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B against the insecure coding\ntesting framework, we continue to observe that larger models both generate more insecure code and also\ngenerate code with a higher average BLEU score (Bhatt et al., 2023).\n• Code interpreter abuse prompt corpus: We identify that Llama 3 models are susceptible to executing\nmalicious code under certain prompts, with Llama 3 405B being particularly susceptible by complying\nwith malicious prompts 10.4% of the time. Llama 3 70B complied at a rate of 3.8%.\n• Text-based prompt injection benchmark: When evaluated against prompt injection benchmarks, prompt\ninjection attacks against Llama 3 405B were successful 21.7% of the time. Figure 22 provides text-based\nprompt injection success rates across Llama 3, GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Pro, and Mixtral models.\n• Vulnerability identification challenges: In assessing Llama 3’s ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities\nusing CyberSecEval 2’s capture-the-flag test challenges, Llama 3 does not outperform commonly used,\ntraditional non-LLM tools and techniques.\n• Spearphishingbenchmark: We evaluate model persuasiveness and success rate in carrying out personalized\nconversations designed to deceive a target into unwittingly participating in security compromises.\nRandomized detailed victim profiles were generated by an LLM to serve as spear phishing targets. A\njudge LLM (Llama 3 70B) scored the performance of Llama 3 70B and 405B in interacting with a victim\nmodel (Llama 3 70B) and evaluated the success of the attempt. Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B were\nevaluated by the judge LLM to be moderately persuasive. Llama 3 70B was judged by an LLM to have\nbeen successful in 24% of spear phishing attempts while Llama 3 405B was judged to be successful in\n14% of attempts. Figure 23 presents judge LLM-evaluated persuasiveness scores across models and\nphishing objectives.\n• Attackautomationframework: We assess Llama 3 70B’s and 405B’s potential to function as an autonomous\nagent across four critical phases of a ransomware attack – network reconnaissance, vulnerability\nidentification, exploit execution, and post exploitation actions.\nWe enable the models to behave\nautonomously by configuring the models to iteratively generate and execute new Linux commands\nin response to output from their prior commands on a Kali Linux virtual machine as they targeted\nanother virtual machine with known vulnerabilities. Although Llama 3 70B and 405B efficiently identify\nnetwork services and open ports in their network reconnaissance, the models fail to effectively use this\ninformation to gain initial access to the vulnerable machine across 20 and 23 test runs respectively. In\nidentifying vulnerabilities, Llama 3 70B and 405B are moderately effective but struggle with selecting\nand applying successful exploitation techniques. Attempts to execute exploits were entirely unsuccessful\nas were post-exploit attempts to maintain access or impact hosts within a network.\nUplift testing for cyber attacks.

Volunteers were\ncategorized into “expert” (31 subjects) and “novice” (31 subjects) cohorts based on their offensive security\nexperience. For the first stage, subjects were asked to complete the challenge without any LLM assistance\nbut with access to the open internet. For the second stage, subjects retained access to the internet but were\nalso provided with Llama 3 405B to complete a different offensive cybersecurity challenge of similar difficulty\nto the first. An analysis of the completion rates of challenge attack phases by subjects indicates that both\nnovices and experts using the 405B model demonstrated insignificant uplift over having open access to the\ninternet without an LLM.\nUplift testing for chemical and biological weapons. To assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and\nbiological weapons, we perform uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3 could meaningfully\nincrease the capabilities of actors to plan such attacks.\nThe study consists of six-hour scenarios where teams of two participants were asked to generate fictitious\noperational plans for either a biological or chemical attack. The scenarios cover the major planning stages of a\nCBRNE attack (agent acquisition, production, weaponization, and delivery) and are designed to elicit detailed\nplans that would address challenges related to procurement of restricted materials, real-world laboratory\nprotocols, and operational security. Participants are recruited based on previous experience in relevant areas of\nscientific or operational expertise, and assigned to teams consisting of two low-skill actors (no formal training)\nor two moderate-skill actors (some formal training and practical experience in science or operations).\nThe study was generated in collaboration with a set of CBRNE experts, and designed to maximize the\ngenerality, validity, and robustness of both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. A preliminary study was\nalso performed in order to validate the study design, including a robust power analysis ensuring that our\nsample size was sufficient for statistical analysis.\nEach team is assigned to a “control” or “LLM” condition. The control team has access to internet-based\nresources only, while the LLM-enabled team had internet access as well as access to Llama 3 models enabled\nwith web search (including PDF ingestion), information retrieval capabilities (RAG), and code execution\n(Python and Wolfram Alpha). To enable testing of RAG capabilities, a keyword search is used to generate a\ndataset of hundreds of relevant scientific papers and pre-loaded into the Llama 3 model inference system. At\nthe conclusion of the exercise, the operational plans generated by each team are evaluated by subject matter\nexperts with domain expertise in biology, chemistry, and operational planning. Each plan is evaluated across\nfour stages of potential attacks, generating scores for metrics such as scientific accuracy, detail, detection\navoidance, and probability of success in scientific and operational execution. After a robust Delphi process\nto mitigate bias and variability in subject matter expert (SME) evaluations, final scores are generated by\npooling stage-level metrics into a comprehensive score.\nQuantitative analysis of these results of this study show no significant uplift in performance related to usage\nof the Llama 3 model. This result holds true when performing an aggregate analysis (comparing all LLM\nconditions to the web-only control condition) as well as for breakdowns by subgroups (e.g., separate evaluation\n47\n\nof the Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B models, or separate evaluation of scenarios related to chemical or\nbiological weapons). After validating these results with CBRNE SMEs, we assess that there is a low risk that\nrelease of Llama 3 models will increase ecosystem risk related to biological or chemical weapon attacks.\n5.4.6\nRed Teaming\nWe utilize Red Teaming to discover risks and use the findings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning\ndatasets. We conduct recurring red teaming exercises to continuously iterate and discover new risks, which\nguides our model development and mitigation process.\nOur red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity,\nin addition to multilingual content specialists with backgrounds in integrity issues for specific geographic\nmarkets. We also partner with internal and external subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to help build\nrisk taxonomies and aid in more focused adversarial assessment.\nAdversarial testing on specific model capabilities. We began initial red teaming by focusing on individual model\ncapabilities in a risk discovery process, in context of specific high-risk categories then testing capabilities\ntogether. The red team focused on prompt-level attacks to emulate more likely more real world scenarios —\nwe find that models often deviate from expected behavior, particularly in cases when the prompt’s intention is\nbeing obfuscated or when prompts layer multiple abstractions. These risks get more complex with additional\ncapabilities, and we describe several of our red teaming discoveries in detail below. We utilize these red\nteam discoveries in concert with our results on internal safety benchmarks to develop focused mitigations to\ncontinuously and iteratively improve model safety.\n• Short and long-context English. We employed a mix of well known, published and unpublished techniques\nacross single and multi-turn conversations. We also leveraged advanced, adversarial multi-turn automa-\ntion similar to PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) across some techniques and risk categories. Largely, multi-turn\nconversations lead to more harmful outputs. Several attacks were pervasive across model checkpoints,\nparticularly when used together.\n– Multi-turn refusal suppression to specify the model response to follow a particular format or\ninclude/exclude particular information related to the refusal as specific phrases.\n– Hypotheticalscenarios wrap violating prompts as hypothetical/theoretical tasks or fictional scenarios.\nPrompts can be as simple as adding the word “hypothetically” or crafting an elaborate layered\nscenario.\n– Personas and role play gives the model a violating persona with specific violating response character-\nistics (e.g. “You are X, your goal is Y”) or yourself as the user adapting a specific benign character\nthat obfuscates the context of the prompt.\n– Adding disclaimers and warnings works as a form of response priming and we assume a method to\nallow for the model a path to helpful compliance that intersects with generalized safety training.\nAsking for disclaimers, trigger warnings and more to be added in multi-turn conversations in\nconcert with other attacks mentioned contributed to increased violation rates.\n– Gradually escalating violation is a multi-turn attack where the conversation starts out with a more or\nless benign request and then through direct prompting for more exaggerated content can gradually\nlead the model into generating a very violating response. Once the model has started outputting\nviolating content, it can be difficult for the model to recover (or another attack can be used if a\nrefusal is encountered). With longer context models, this will be an increasingly seen issue.\n• Multilingual. We identify a number of unique risks when considering multiple languages.\n– Mixing multiple languages in one prompt or conversation can easily lead to more violating outputs\nthan if a single language was used.\n– Lower resource languages can lead to violating outputs given a lack of related safety fine tuning\ndata, weak model generalization of safety or prioritization of testing or benchmarks. However, this\nattack often result in poor quality generally, limiting real adversarial use.\n48\n\n– Slang, specific context or cultural-specific references can confuse or appear to be violating at first\nglance, only to see the model does not comprehend a given reference correctly to make an output\ntruly harmful or prevent it from being a violating output.\n• Tool use. During testing, apart from English-text level adversarial prompting techniques being successful\nin generating violating outputs, several tool specific attacks were also discovered. This included but was\nnot limited to:\n– Unsafe tool chaining such as asking for multiple tools at once with one being violating could, in\nearly checkpoints, lead to all of the tools being called with a mix of benign and violating inputs.\n– Forcing tool use often with specific input strings, fragmented or encoded text can trigger a tool\ninput to be potentially violating, leading to a more violating output. Other techniques can then be\nused to access the tool results, even if the model would normally refuse to perform the search or\nassist with the results.\n– Modifying tool use parameters such as swapping words in queries, retrying, or obfuscating some of\nthe initial request in a multi-turn conversation lead to violations in many early checkpoints as a\nform of forcing tool use.\nChild safety risks. Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the\nmodel’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and\nappropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the\ncoverage of our evaluation benchmarks through model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth\nsessions using objective based methodologies to assess model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also\npartnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content\nwhile taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n5.4.7\nSystem Level Safety\nIn various real-world applications of large language models, models are not used in isolation but are integrated\ninto broader systems. In this section, we describe our system level safety implementation, which supplements\nmodel-level mitigations by providing more flexibility and control.\nTo enable this, we develop and release a new classifier, Llama Guard 3, which is a Llama 3 8B model fine-tuned\nfor safety classification. Similar to Llama Guard 2 (Llama-Team, 2024), this classifier is used to detect\nwhether input prompts and/or output responses generated by language models violate safety policies on\nspecific categories of harm.\nIt is designed to support Llama’s growing capabilities, and can be used for English and multilingual text. It is\nalso optimized to be used in the context of tool-calls such as search-tools and preventing code interpreter\nabuse. Finally, we also provide quantized variants to reduce memory requirements. We encourage developers\nto use our release of system safety components as a foundation and configure them for their own use cases.\nTaxonomy. We train on the 13 hazard categories listed in the AI Safety taxonomy (Vidgen et al., 2024): Child\nSexual Exploitation, Defamation, Elections, Hate, Indiscriminate Weapons, Intellectual Property, Non-Violent\nCrimes, Privacy, Sex-Related Crimes, Sexual Content, Specialized Advice, Suicide & Self-Harm, and Violent\nCrimes. We also train on Code Interpreter Abuse category to support tool-calls use cases.\nTraining data. We start with the English data used by Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023) and expand this dataset\nto incorporate new capabilities. For new capabilities such as multilingual and tool use, we collect prompt and\nresponse classification data, as well as utilize the data collected for safety finetuning. We increase the number\nof unsafe responses in the training set by doing prompt engineering to get the LLM to not refuse responding\nto adversarial prompts. We use Llama 3 to obtain response labels on such generated data.\nTo improve the performance of Llama Guard 3, we do extensive cleaning of the collected samples using human\nannotation as well as LLM annotation by Llama 3. Obtaining labels for user prompts is a much harder task\nfor both humans and LLMs, and we find that the human labels are slightly better, especially for borderline\nprompts, though our full iterative system is able to reduce the noise and produce more accurate labels.\n49\n\nInput Llama Guard\nOutput Llama Guard\nFull Llama Guard\nCapability\nVR\nFRR\nVR\nFRR\nVR\nFRR\nEnglish\n-76%\n+95%\n-75%\n+25%\n-86%\n+102%\nFrench\n-38%\n+27%\n-45%\n+4%\n-59%\n+29%\nGerman\n-57%\n+32%\n-60%\n+14%\n-77%\n+37%\nHindi\n-54%\n+60%\n-54%\n+14%\n-71%\n+62%\nItalian\n-34%\n+27%\n-34%\n+5%\n-48%\n+29%\nPortuguese\n-51%\n+35%\n-57%\n+13%\n-65%\n+39%\nSpanish\n-41%\n+26%\n-50%\n+10%\n-60%\n+27%\nThai\n-43%\n+37%\n-39%\n+8%\n-51%\n+39%\nTable 25 Violation Rate (VR) and False Refusal Rate (FRR) relative to Llama 3 when using Llama Guard 3 for input or output\nfiltering on different languages. For example, -50% for VR means that there is a 50% reduction in the rate of Llama 3\nmodel violations when using Llama Guard. Evaluations are performed on generations from the 405B-parameter Llama\n3 model. Lower is better.\nResults. Llama Guard 3 is able to significantly reduce violations across capabilities (-65% violations on average\nacross our benchmarks). Note that adding system safeguards (and any safety mitigations in general) comes\nat the cost of increased refusals to benign prompts. In Table 25 we report reductions in violation rate and\nincreases in false refusal rate increase compared to the base model to highlight this tradeoff. This effect is\nalso visible in Figures 19, 20, and 21.\nSystem safety also offers more flexibility. Llama Guard 3 can be deployed for specific harms only enabling\ncontrol over the violations and false refusals trade-off at the harm category level. Table 26 presents violations\nreduction per category to inform which category should be turned on/off based on the developer use case.\nTo make it easier to deploy safety systems, we provide a quantized version of Llama Guard 3 using the\ncommonly used int8 quantization technique, reducing its size by more than 40%. Table 27 illustrates that\nquantization has negligible impact on the performance of the model.\nPrompt-based system guards. System-level safety components enable developers to customize and control how\nLLM systems respond to user requests. As part of our work on improving the overall safety of the model\nsystem and enable developers to deploy responsibly, we describe and release the creation of two prompt-based\nfiltering mechanisms: Prompt Guard and Code Shield. We open-source these for the community to leverage\nas-is or take as inspiration and adapt for their usecases.\nPrompt Guard is a model-based filter designed to detect prompt attacks, which are input strings designed to\nsubvert the intended behavior of an LLM functioning as part of an application. The model is a multi-label\nclassifier that detects two classes of prompt attack risk - direct jailbreaks (techniques that explicitly try to\noverride a model’s safety conditioning or system prompt) and indirect prompt injections (instances where\nthird-party data included in a model’s context window includes instructions inadvertently executed as user\ncommands by an LLM). The model is fine-tuned from mDeBERTa-v3-base, a small (86M) parameter model\nsuitable for filtering inputs into an LLM. We evaluate the performance on several evaluation datasets shown\nin Table 28. We evaluate on two datasets (jailbreaks and injections) drawn from the same distribution\nas the training data, as well as an out-of-distribution dataset in English, a multilingual jailbreak set built\nfrom machine translation, and a dataset of indirect injections drawn from CyberSecEval (both English and\nmultilingual). Overall, we find that the model generalizes well to new distributions and has strong performance.\nCode Shield is an example of a class of system-level protections based on providing inference-time filtering.\nIn particular, it focuses on detecting the generation of insecure code before it might enter a downstream\nusecase such as a production system. It does so by leveraging a static analysis library, the Insecure Code\nDetector (ICD), to identify insecure code. ICD uses a suite of static analysis tools to perform the analysis\nacross 7 programming languages. These kinds of guardrails are generally useful for developers, who can deploy\nmulti-layered protections in various applications.\n50\n\nCategory\nInput Llama Guard\nOutput Llama Guard\nFull Llama Guard\nFalse Refusal Rate Relative to Llama 3:\n+95%\n+25%\n+102%\nViolation Rate Relative to Llama 3:\n- Child Sexual Exploitation\n-53%\n-47%\n-59%\n- Defamation\n-86%\n-100%\n-100%\n- Elections\n-100%\n-100%\n-100%\n- Hate\n-36%\n-82%\n-91%\n- Indiscriminate Weapons14\n0%\n0%\n0%\n- Intellectual Property\n-88%\n-100%\n-100%\n- Non-Violent Crimes\n-80%\n-80%\n-100%\n- Privacy\n-40%\n-60%\n-60%\n- Sex-Related Crimes\n-75%\n-75%\n-88%\n- Sexual Content\n-100%\n-100%\n-100%\n- Specialized Advice\n-70%\n-70%\n-70%\n- Suicide & Self-Harm\n-62%\n-31%\n-62%\n- Violent Crimes\n-67%\n-53%\n-80%\nTable 26 Violation rate and false refusal rate relative to Llama 3 when using Llama Guard 3 for input or output filtering on\ndifferent safety categories.

Llama 3 may still\ngenerate harmful content due to training on various datasets, particularly for languages beyond English and\nwhen prompt engineered by skilled adversarial red teamers. Malicious developers or adversarial users may find\nnew ways to jailbreak our models and use them for various nefarious usecases. We will continue to proactively\nidentify risks, conduct research on mitigation methods, and we encourage developers to consider responsibility\nin every aspect — from model development to deployment to users. We hope developers will leverage and\ncontribute to the tools we release in our open-source system-level safety suite.\n6\nInference\nWe investigate two main techniques to make inference with the Llama 3 405B model efficient: (1) pipeline\nparallelism and (2) FP8 quantization. We have publicly released our implementation of FP8 quantization.\n6.1\nPipeline Parallelism\nWhen using a BF16 number representation for the model parameters, Llama 3 405B does not fit in the GPU\nmemory of a single machine with 8 Nvidia H100 GPUs. To address this issue, we parallelize model inference\nusing BF16 precision across 16 GPUs on two machines. Within each machine, the high NVLink bandwidth\n51\n\nMetric\nJailbreaks\nInjections\nOut-of-Distribution Jailbreaks\nMultilingual Jailbreaks\nIndirect Injections\nTPR\n99.9%\n99.5%\n97.5%\n91.5%\n71.4%\nFPR\n0.4%\n0.8%\n3.9%\n5.3%\n1.0%\nAUC\n0.997\n1.000\n0.975\n0.959\n0.996\nTable 28 Performance of Prompt Guard.

The numbers in the plot correspond to the (micro-)batch size.\nenables the use of tensor parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019). Across nodes, however, connectivity has lower\nbandwidth and higher latency, so we use pipeline parallelism (Huang et al., 2019) instead.\nDuring training with pipeline parallelism, bubbles are a major efficiency concern (see Section 3.3). However,\nthey are not an issue during inference, since inference does not involve a backward pass that requires a pipeline\nflush. Therefore, we use micro-batching to improve inference throughput with pipeline parallelism.\nWe evaluate the effect of using two micro-batches in inference workloads of 4,096 input tokens and 256 output\ntokens both during the key-value cache pre-fill stage of inference and during the decoding stage. We find\nthat micro-batching improves throughput of inference with the same local batch size; see Figure 24. These\nimprovements result from micro-batching enabling concurrent execution of micro batches in both these stages.\nThe additional synchronization points due to micro-batching also increase latency but, overall, micro-batching\nstill leads to a better throughput-latency trade-off.\n6.2\nFP8 Quantization\nWe perform experiments leveraging the native FP8 support of H100 GPUs to perform low-precision inference.\nTo enable low-precision inference, we apply FP8 quantization to most matrix multiplications inside the\nmodel. In particular, we quantize most parameters and activations in the feedforward network layers in the\nmodel, which account for roughly 50% of the inference compute time. We do not quantize parameters in\nthe self-attention layers of the model. We leverage dynamic scaling factors for better accuracy (Xiao et al.,\n2024b), optimizing our CUDA kernels15 to reduce the overhead of calculating the scales. We find that the\nquality of Llama 3 405B is sensitive to certain types of quantization, and make a few additional changes to\nincrease the model output quality:\n1. Akin to Zhang et al. (2021), we do not perform quantization in the first and last Transformer layers.\n2. High-perplexity tokens such as dates can lead to large activation values. In turn, these can lead to high\ndynamic scaling factors in FP8 and a non-negligible number of underflows, leading to errors in decoding.\n15Our FP8 kernels are available at https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu/experimental/gen_ai.\nWe provide usage examples at https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system.\n52\n\nFigure 25 Illustration of tensor-wise and row-wise FP8 quantization.

Our FP8 quantization approach has\nnegligible impact on the model’s responses.\nTo address this issue, we upper bound the dynamic scaling factors to 1200.\n3. We use row-wise quantization, computing scaling factors across rows for parameter and activation\nmatrices (see Figure 25). We find this works better than a tensor-wise quantization approach.\nEffect of quantization errors. Evaluations on standard benchmarks often suggest that FP8 inference performs\non par with BF16 inference even without these mitigations. However, we find that such benchmarks do not\nadequately reflect the effects of FP8 quantization. When scaling factors are not upper bounded, the model\noccasionally produces corrupted responses even though the benchmark performance is strong. Instead of\nrelying on benchmarks to measure distribution changes due to quantization, we find it is better to analyze the\ndistribution of reward-model scores for 100, 000 responses produced using both FP8 and BF16. Figure 26\nshows the resulting reward distribution for our quantization approach. The results in the figure show that our\napproach to FP8 quantization has very limited impact on the model’s response.\nExperimental evaluation of efficiency. Figure 27 depicts the throughput-latency trade-off of performing FP8\ninference with Llama 3 405B in the pre-fill and decoding stages, using 4,096 input tokens and 256 output tokens.\nThe figure compares the efficiency of FP8 inference with that of the two-machine BF16 inference approach\ndescribed in Section 6.1. The results show that use of FP8 inference leads to throughput improvements of up\nto 50% during the pre-fill stage, and a substantially better throughput-latency trade-off during decoding.\n53\n\nFigure 27 Throughput-latency trade-off in FP8 inference with Llama 3 405B compared with BF16 inference using different\npipeline parallelization setups. Left: Results for pre-filling. Right: Results for decoding.\n7\nVision Experiments\nWe perform a series of experiments in which we incorporate visual-recognition capabilities into Llama 3 via\na compositional approach that consists of two main stages. First, we compose a pre-trained image encoder\n(Xu et al., 2023) and the pre-trained language model by introducing and training a set of cross-attention\nlayers between the two models (Alayrac et al., 2022) on a large number of image-text pairs. This leads to\nthe model illustrated in Figure 28. Second, we introduce temporal aggregator layers and additional video\ncross-attention layers that operate on a large collection of video-text pairs to learn the model to recognize and\nprocess temporal information from videos.\nA compositional approach to foundation model development has several advantages: (1) it enables us to\nparallelize the development of the vision and language modeling capabilities; (2) it circumvents complexities\nof joint pre-training on visual and language data that stem from tokenization of visual data, differences in\nbackground perplexities of tokens originating from different modalities, and contention between modalities; (3)\nit guarantees that model performance on text-only tasks is not affected by the introduction of visual-recognition\ncapabilities, and (4) the cross-attention architecture ensures that we do not have to expend compute passing\nfull-resolution images through the increasingly LLM backbones (specifically, the feed-forward networks in\neach transformer layer), making it more efficient during inference. We note that our multimodal models are\nstill under development and not yet ready for release.\nBefore presenting the results of our experiments in Section 7.6 and 7.7, we describe the data we used to train\nvisual recognition capabilities, the model architecture of the vision components, how we scale training of those\ncomponents, and our pre-training and post-training recipes.\n7.1\nData\nWe describe our image and video data separately below.\n7.1.1\nImage Data\nOur image encoder and adapter are trained on image-text pairs. We construct this dataset via a complex\ndata processing pipeline that consists of four main stages: (1) quality filtering, (2) perceptual de-duplication,\n(3) resampling, and (4) optical character recognition. We also apply a series of safety mitigations.\n• Quality filtering. We implement quality filters that remove non-English captions and low-quality captions\nvia heuristics such as low alignment scores produced by (Radford et al., 2021). Specifically, we remove\nall image-text pairs below a certain CLIP score.\n• De-duplication. De-duplicating large-scale training datasets benefits model performance because it\nreduces training compute spent on redundant data (Esser et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2021; Abbas et al.,\n54\n\nFigure 28 Illustration of the compositional approach to adding multimodal capabilities to Llama 3 that we study in this paper. This\napproach leads to a multimodal model that is trained in five stages: (1) language model pre-training, (2) multi-modal\nencoder pre-training, (3) vision adapter training, (4) model finetuning, and (5) speech adapter training.\n2023) and memorization (Carlini et al., 2023; Somepalli et al., 2023). Hence, we de-duplicate our training\ndata for both efficiency and privacy reasons. To do so, we use an internal version of the state-of-the-art\nSSCD copy-detection model (Pizzi et al., 2022) to de-duplicate images at scale. For all images, we\nfirst compute a 512-dimensional representation using the SSCD model. We use those embeddings to\nperform a nearest neighbor (NN) search for each image across all images in our data set, using a cosine\nsimilarity measure. We define examples above a certain similarity threshold as duplicates. We group\nthese duplicates using a connected-components algorithm, and maintain only one image-text pair per\nconnected component. We increase the efficiency of our de-duplication pipeline by: (1) pre-clustering the\ndata using k-means clusters and (2) using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) for NN searches and clustering.\n• Resampling. We ensure diversity of the image-text pairs via resampling akin to Xu et al. (2023);\nMahajan et al. (2018); Mikolov et al. (2013). First, we construct a vocabulary of n-grams by parsing\nhigh-quality text sources. Next, we compute the frequency of each vocabulary n-gram in our dataset.\nWe then resample the data as follows: If any of the n-grams in a caption occurs less than T times in the\nvocabulary, we keep the corresponding image-text pair. Otherwise, we independently sample each of\nthe n-grams ni in the caption with probability\np\nT/fi where fi indicates the frequency of n-gram ni;\nwe keep the image-text pair if any of the n-grams was sampled. This resampling aids performance on\nlow-frequency categories and fine-grained recognition tasks.\n• Optical character recognition. We further improve our image-text data by extracting text written in the\nimage and concatenating it with the caption. The written text is extracted using a proprietary optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR) pipeline. We observe that adding OCR data into the training data greatly\nimproves tasks that require OCR capabilities, such as document understanding.\nTranscribing documents. To improve the performance of our models on document understanding tasks, we\nrender pages from documents as images and paired the images with their respective text. The document text\nis obtained either directly from the source or via a document parsing pipeline.\nSafety. We focus primarily on ensuring that the pre-training dataset for image recognition does not contain\n55\n\nunsafe content, such as sexual abuse material (CSAM) (Thiel, 2023). We scan all our training images for\nCSAM using perceptual hashing approaches such as PhotoDNA (Farid, 2021) as well as internal, proprietary\nclassifiers. We also use a proprietary media-risk retrieval pipeline to identify and remove image-text pairs\nthat we consider to be NSFW, for example, because they contain sexual or violent content. We believe that\nminimizing the prevalence of such material in the training dataset improves the safety of the final model\nwithout impacting its helpfulness. Finally, we perform face blurring on all images in our training set. We test\nthe model against human generated prompts that refer to an attached image.\nAnnealing data. We create an annealing dataset by resampling the image-caption pairs to a smaller volume of\n∼350M examples using n-grams. Since the n-grams resampling favor richer text descriptions, this selects a\nhigher-quality data subset. We augment the resulting data with ∼150M examples from five additional sources:\n• Visual grounding. We link noun phrases in the text to bounding boxes or masks in the image. The\ngrounding information (bounding boxes and masks) are specified in the image-text pair in two ways. (1)\nWe overlay boxes or masks with marks on the image and use marks in the text as reference, akin to\nset-of-marks (Yang et al., 2023a). (2) We insert normalized (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) coordinates directly\ninto the text, demarcated by special tokens.\n• Screenshot parsing. We render screenshots from HTML code and task the model with predicting the\ncode that produced a specific element in the screenshot, akin to Lee et al. (2023). The element of\ninterest is indicated in the screenshot via a bounding box.\n• Question-answer pairs. We include question-answer pairs, enabling us to use volumes of question-\nanswering data that are too large to be used in model finetuning.\n• Synthetic captions. We include images with synthetic captions that were generated by an early version of\nthe model. Compared to original captions, we find that synthetic captions provide a more comprehensive\ndescription of images than the original captions.\n• Synthetically-generated structured images. We also include synthetically generated images for a variety\nof domains such as charts, tables, flowcharts, math equations and textual data. These images are\naccompanied by a structured representation such as the corresponding markdown or LaTeX notation.\nBesides improving recognition capabilities of the model for these domains, we find this data useful to\ngenerate question-answer pairs via the text model for finetuning.\n7.1.2\nVideo Data\nFor video pre-training, we use a large dataset of video-text pairs. Our dataset is curated through a multi-stage\nprocess. We filter and clean the associated texts using rule-based heuristics, such as ensuring a minimum\nlength and fixing capitalization. Then, we run language identification models to filter out non-English texts.\nWe run OCR detection models to filter out videos with excessive overlaid text. To ensure reasonable alignment\nbetween the video-text pairs, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) style image-text and video-text contrastive\nmodels. We first compute image-text similarity using a single frame in the videos and filtered out low similarity\npairs, and then subsequently filter out pairs with low video-text alignment. Some of our data contains static\nor low-motion videos; we filter out such data using motion-score based filtering (Girdhar et al., 2023). We do\nnot apply any filters on the visual quality of the videos such as aesthetic scores or resolution filtering.\nOur dataset contains videos with an average duration of 21 seconds and a median duration of 16 seconds,\nwith over 99% videos being under a minute. The spatial resolution varies significantly between 320p and 4K\nvideos, with over 70% of the videos having a short side greater than 720 pixels. The videos have varying\naspect ratios with almost all videos having between aspect ratio between 1:2 and 2:1, with a 1:1 median.\n7.2\nModel Architecture\nOur visual-recognition model consists of three main components: (1) an image encoder, (2) an image adapter,\nand (3) a video adapter.\nImage encoder. Our image encoder is a standard vision transformer (ViT; Dosovitskiy et al. (2020)) that\nis trained to align images and text (Xu et al., 2023). We use the ViT-H/14 variant of the image encoder,\n56\n\nwhich has 630M parameters that were trained on 2.5B image-text pairs for five epochs. The image encoder\nis pre-trained on images with resolution 224 × 224; images were split up into 16 × 16 patches of equal size\n(i.e., a patch size of 14x14 pixels). As also demonstrated by prior work such as ViP-Llava (Cai et al., 2024),\nwe observe that image encoders trained via a contrastive text alignment objective are unable to preserve\nfine-grained localization information. To alleviate this, we employ a multi-layer feature extraction, where\nfeatures from the 4th, 8th, 16th, 24th and 31st layers are also provided in addition to the final layer features.\nIn addition, we further insert 8 gated self-attention layers (making a total of 40 transformer blocks) prior to\npre-training of the cross-attention layers to learn alignment-specific features. The image encoder therefore\neventually has a total 850M parameters with the additional layers. With the multi-layer features, the image\nencoder produces a 7680-dimensional representation for each of the resulting 16 × 16 = 256 patches. The\nparameters of the image encoder are not frozen during subsequent training stages as we found it to improve\nperformance, especially in domains such as text recognition.\nImage adapter. We introduce cross-attention layers between the visual token representations produced by the\nimage encoder and the token representations produced by the language model (Alayrac et al., 2022). The\ncross-attention layers are applied after every fourth self-attention layer in the core language model. Like the\nlanguage model itself, the cross-attention layers use generalized query attention (GQA) for increased efficiency.\nThe cross-attention layers introduce substantial numbers of additional trainable parameters into the model:\nfor Llama 3 405B, the cross-attention layers have ≈100B parameters. We pre-train our image adapter in two\nstages: (1) initial pre-training followed by (2) annealing:\n• Initial pre-training. We pre-train our image adapter on our dataset of ∼6B image-text pairs described\nabove. For compute efficiency reasons, we resize all images to fit within at most four tiles of 336 × 336\npixels each, where we arrange the tiles to support different aspect ratios, e.g., 672 × 672, 672 × 336, and\n1344 × 336.\n• Annealing. We continue training the image adapter on ∼500M images from the annealing dataset\ndescribed above. During annealing, we increase the per-tile image resolution to improve performance on\ntasks that require higher-resolution images, for example, infographics understanding.\nVideo adapter. Our model takes as input up to 64 frames (uniformly sampled from a full video), each of\nwhich is processed by the image encoder. We model temporal structure in videos through two components:\n(i) encoded video frames are aggregated by a temporal aggregator which merges 32 consecutive frames into\none, (ii) additional video cross attention layers are added before every fourth image cross attention layer. The\ntemporal aggregator is implemented as a perceiver resampler (Jaegle et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). We\npre-train using 16 frames per video (aggregated to 1 frame), but increase the number of input frames to 64\nduring supervised finetuning. The video aggregator and cross attention layers have 0.6B and 4.6B parameters\nfor Llama 3 7B and 70B, respectively.\n7.3\nModel Scaling\nAfter the visual-recognition components are added to Llama 3, the model contains self-attention layers, cross-\nattention layers, and a ViT image encoder. To train adapters for the smaller 8B and 70B parameter models,\nwe found a combination of data and tensor parallelization is the most efficient. Model or pipeline parallelism\ndoes not increase efficiency at these scales because the gathering of model parameters would dominate the\ncomputation. We do, however, use pipeline parallelism (in addition to data and tensor parallelism) when\ntraining the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in\naddition to those outlined in Section 3.3: model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and numerical instabilities.\nModel heterogeneity. The model computation is heterogeneous because more computation is performed on\nsome tokens than on others. In particular, image tokens are processed by the image encoder and the cross-\nattention layers, whereas text tokens are only processed by the language backbone. This heterogeneity leads\nto bottlenecks in the scheduling of pipeline parallelism. We address this problem by ensuring each pipeline\nstage contains five layers: namely, four self-attention layers in the language backbone and a cross-attention\nlayer. (Recall that we introduce a cross-attention layer after every fourth self-attention layer.) In addition, we\nreplicate the image encoder on all pipeline stages. Because we train on paired image-text data, this enables us\nto perform load balancing between the image and text parts of the computation.\n57\n\nData heterogeneity. The data is heterogeneous because, on average, images have more tokens than the\nassociated text: an image has 2,308 tokens, whereas the associated text contains an average of only 192 tokens.\nAs a result, the computation of cross-attention layers requires more time and memory than the computation\nof self-attention layers. We address this problem by introducing sequence parallelization in the image encoder,\nso that each GPU processes roughly the same number of tokens. Because the average text size is relatively\nshort, we also use a substantially larger micro-batch size (8 instead of 1).\nNumerical instabilities. After the image encoder is added to the model, we find that performing gradient\naccumulation in bf16 led to numerical instabilities. The most likely explanation for this is that image tokens\nare introduced into the language backbone via all cross-attention layers. This implies that numerical deviations\nin the representation of an image token have an outsized impact on the overall computation because the errors\nare compounded. We address this by performing gradient accumulation in FP32.\n7.4\nPre-training\nImage. We initialize from the pre-trained text model and vision encoder weights. The vision encoder is\nunfrozen, while the text model weights are kept frozen as explained above. First, we train the model using 6B\nimage-text pairs where each image is resized to fit within four tiles of 336 × 336 pixels. We use a global batch\nsize of 16,384 and a cosine learning rate schedule with initial learning rate 10 × 10−4 and a weight decay of\n0.01. The initial learning rate was determined based on small-scale experiments. However, these findings did\nnot generalize well to very long training schedules and dropped the learning rate a few times during training\nwhen the loss values became stagnant. After the base pre-training, we increase the image resolution further\nand continue training the same weights on the annealing dataset. The optimizer is re-initialized via warm-up\nto learning rate 2 × 10−5 and again follows a cosine schedule.\nVideo. For video pre-training, we start from the image pre-trained and annealed weights as described above. We\nadd the video aggregator and cross-attention layers as described in the architecture, initialized randomly. We\nfreeze all the parameters in the model except the video-specific ones (the aggregator and video cross-attention),\nand train them on the video pre-training data. We use the same training hyperparameters as the image\nannealing stage, with small differences in the learning rate. We uniformly sample 16 frames from the full video,\nand represent each frame using four chunks, each of size of 448 × 448 pixels. We use an aggregation factor of\n16 in the video aggregator, hence obtaining one effective frame, which the text tokens cross-attend to. We use\na global batch size of 4,096, a sequence length of 190 tokens, and a learning rate of 10−4 during training.\n7.5\nPost-Training\nIn this section, we describe the post-training recipe for our vision adapters. After pre-training, we fine-tune the\nmodel on highly curated multi-modal conversational data to enable chat capabilities. We further implement\ndirect preference optimization (DPO) to boost human evaluation performance and rejection sampling to\nimprove multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Finally, we add a quality-tuning stage where we continue fine-\ntuning the model on a very small set of high-quality conversational data which further boosts human evaluation\nwhile retaining performance across benchmarks. More details on each of these steps are provided below.\n7.5.1\nSupervised Finetuning Data\nWe describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) data for image and video capabilities separately below.\nImage. We utilize a mix of different datasets for supervised finetuning.\n• Academic datasets. We convert a highly filtered collection of existing academic datasets to question-\nanswer pairs using templates or via LLM rewriting. The LLM rewriting’s purpose is to augment the\ndata with different instructions and to improve the language quality of answers.\n• Human annotations. We collect multi-modal conversation data via human annotators for a wide range of\ntasks (open-ended question-answering, captioning, practical use cases, etc.) and domains (e.g., natural\nimages and structured images). Annotators are provided with images and asked to write conversations.\nTo ensure diversity, we cluster large-scale datasets and sampled images uniformly across different clusters.\nFurther, we acquire additional images for a few specific domains by expanding a seed via k-nearest\n58\n\nneighbors. Annotators are also provided with intermediate checkpoints of existing models to facilitate\nmodel-in-the-loop style annotations, so that model generations can be utilized as a starting point by\nthe annotators to then provide additional human edits. This is an iterative process, in which model\ncheckpoints would be regularly updated with better performing versions trained on the latest data. This\nincreases the volume and efficiency of human annotations, while also improving their quality.\n• Synthetic data.\nWe explore different ways to generate synthetic multi-modal data by using text-\nrepresentations of images and a text-input LLM. The high-level idea is to utilize the reasoning capa-\nbilities of text-input LLMs to generate question-answer pairs in the text domain, and replace the text\nrepresentation with its corresponding images to produce synthetic multi-modal data. Examples include\nrendering texts from question-answer datasets as images or rendering table data into synthetic images of\ntables and charts. Additionally, we use captions and OCR extractions from existing images to generate\nadditional conversational or question-answer data related to the images.\nVideo. Similar to the image adapter, we use academic datasets with pre-existing annotations and convert them\ninto appropriate textual instructions and target responses. The targets are converted to open-ended responses\nor multiple-choice options, whichever is more appropriate. We ask humans to annotate videos with questions\nand corresponding answers. The annotators are asked to focus on questions that could not be answered based\non a single frame, to steer the annotators towards questions that require temporal understanding.\n7.5.2\nSupervised Finetuning Recipe\nWe describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) recipe for image and video capabilities separately below.\nImage. We initialize from the pre-trained image adapter, but hot-swap the pre-trained language model’s\nweights with the instruction tuned language model’s weights. The language model weights are kept frozen to\nmaintain text-only performance, i.e., we only update the vision encoder and image adapter weights.\nOur approach to finetune the model is similar to Wortsman et al. (2022). First, we run a hyperparameter\nsweep using multiple random subsets of data, learning rates and weight decay values. Next, we rank the\nmodels based on their performance. Finally, we average the weights of the top-K models to obtain the final\nmodel. The value of K is determined by evaluating the averaged models and selecting the instance with\nhighest performance. We observe that the averaged models consistently yield better results compared to the\nbest individual model found via grid search. Further, this strategy reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters.\nVideo. For video SFT, we initialize the video aggregator and cross-attention layers using the pre-trained\nweights. The rest of the parameters in the model, the image weights and the LLM, are initialized from\ncorresponding models following their finetuning stages. Similar to video pre-training, we then finetune only\nthe video parameters on the video SFT data. For this stage, we increase the video length to 64 frames, and\nuse an aggregation factor of 32 to get two effective frames. The resolution of the chunks is also increased to\nbe consistent with the corresponding image hyperparameters.\n7.5.3\nPreference Data\nWe built multimodal pair-wise preference datasets for reward modeling and direct preference optimization.\n• Human annotations. The human-annotated preference data consists of comparisons between two different\nmodel outputs, labeled as “chosen” and “rejected”, with 7-scale ratings. The models used to generate\nresponses are sampled on-the-fly from a pool of the best recent models, each with different characteristics.\nWe update the model pool weekly. Besides preference labels, we also request annotators to provide\noptional human edits to correct inaccuracies in “chosen” responses because vision tasks have a low\ntolerance for inaccuracies. Note that human editing is an optional step because there is a trade-off\nbetween volume and quality in practice.\n• Synthetic data. Synthetic preference pairs could also be generated by using text-only LLMs to edit and\ndeliberately introduce errors in the supervised finetuning dataset. We took the conversational data as\ninput, and use an LLM to introduce subtle but meaningful errors (e.g., change objects, change attributes,\nadd mistakes in calculations, etc.). These edited responses are used as negative “rejected” samples and\npaired with the “chosen” original supervised finetuning data.\n59\n\n• Rejection sampling. Furthermore, to create more on-policy negative samples, we leveraged the iterative\nprocess of rejection sampling to collect additional preference data. We discuss our usage of rejection\nsampling in more detail in the following sections. At a high-level, rejection sampling is used to iteratively\nsample high-quality generations from a model. Therefore, as a by-product, all generations that are not\nselected can be used as negative rejected samples and used as additional preference data pairs.\n7.5.4\nReward Modeling\nWe train a vision reward model (RM) on top of the vision SFT model and the language RM. The vision\nencoder and the cross-attention layers are initialized from the vision SFT model and unfrozen during training,\nwhile the self-attention layers are initialized from the language RM and kept frozen. We observe that freezing\nthe language RM part generally leads to better accuracy, especially on tasks that require the RM to judge\nbased on its knowledge or the language quality. We adopt the same training objective as the language RM,\nbut adding a weighted regularization term on the square of the reward logits averaged over the batch, which\nprevents the reward scores from drifting.\nThe human preference annotations in Section 7.5.3 are used to train the vision RM. We follow the same\npractice as language preference data (Section 4.2.1) to create two or three pairs with clear ranking (edited\n> chosen > rejected). In addition, we also synthetically augment the negative responses by perturbing the\nwords or phrases related to the information in the image (such as numbers or visual texts). This encourages\nthe vision RM to ground its judgement based on the actual image content.\n7.5.5\nDirect Preference Optimization\nSimilar to the language model (Section 4.1.4), we further train the vision adapters with Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) using the preference data described in Section 7.5.3. To combat the\ndistribution shift during post-training rounds, we only keep recent batches of human preference annotations\nwhile dropping batches that are sufficiently off-policy (e.g., if the base pre-trained model is changed). We find\nthat instead of always freezing the reference model, updating it in an exponential moving average (EMA)\nfashion every k-steps helps the model learn more from the data, resulting in better performance in human\nevaluations. Overall, we observed that the vision DPO model consistently performs better than its SFT\nstarting point in human evaluations for every finetuning iteration.\n7.5.6\nRejection Sampling\nMost available question-answer pairs only contain the final answer and lack the chain-of-thought explanation\nthat is required to train a model that generalizes well for reasoning tasks. We use rejection sampling to\ngenerate the missing explanations for such examples and boost the model’s reasoning capabilities.\nGiven a question-answer pair, we generate multiple answers by sampling the finetuned model with different\nsystem prompts or temperature. Next, we compare the generated answers to the ground-truth via heuristics\nor an LLM judge. Finally, we retrain the model by adding the correct answers back into the finetuning data\nmix. We find it useful to keep multiple correct answers per question.\nTo ensure we only add high-quality examples back into training, we implemented the following two guardrails.\nFirst, we find that some examples contain incorrect explanations, despite the final answer being correct. We\nobserved that this pattern occurs more frequently for questions where only a small fraction of the generated\nanswers is correct. Therefore, we drop answers for questions where the probability of the answer being correct\nis below a certain threshold. Second, raters prefer some answers over others due to differences in language or\nstyle. We use the reward model to select top-K highest-quality answers and add them back into training.\n7.5.7\nQuality Tuning\nWe curate a small but highly selective SFT dataset where all samples have been rewritten and verified either\nby humans or our best models to meet our highest standards. We train DPO models with this data to improve\nresponse quality, calling the process Quality-Tuning (QT). We find that QT significantly improves human\nevaluations without affecting generalization verified by benchmarks when the QT dataset covers a wide range\n60\n\nLlama 3-V 8B\nLlama 3-V 70B\nLlama 3-V 405B\nGPT-4V\nGPT-4o\nGemini 1.5 Pro\nClaude 3.5\nMMMU (val, CoT)\n49.6\n60.6\n64.5\n56.4\n69.1\n62.2\n68.3\nVQAv2 (test-dev)\n78.0\n79.1\n80.2\n77.2\n–\n80.2\n–\nAI2 Diagram (test)\n84.4\n93.0\n94.1\n78.2\n94.2\n94.4\n94.7\nChartQA (test, CoT)\n78.7\n83.2\n85.8\n78.4\n85.7\n87.2\n90.8\nTextVQA (val)\n78.2\n83.4\n84.8\n78.0\n–\n78.7\n–\nDocVQA (test)\n84.4\n92.2\n92.6\n88.4\n92.8\n93.1△\n95.2\nTable 29 Image understanding performance of our vision module attached to Llama 3.

We select checkpoints at this stage purely based on benchmarks\nto ensure capabilities are retained or improved.\n7.6\nImage Recognition Results\nWe evaluate the performance of the image understanding capabilities of Llama 3 on a range of tasks spanning\nnatural image understanding, text understanding, charts understanding and multimodal reasoning:\n• MMMU (Yue et al., 2024a) is a challenging dataset for mulitmodal reasoning where model is expected to\nunderstand images and solve college-level problems spanning 30 different disciplines. This includes both\nmultiple-choice and open ended questions. We evaluate our model on the validation set with 900 images,\nin line with other works.\n• VQAv2 (Antol et al., 2015) tests the ability of a model to combine image understanding, language\nunderstanding and commonsense knowlege to answer generic questions about natural images\n• AI2 Diagram (Kembhavi et al., 2016) evaluates models capability to parse scientific diagrams and answer\nquestions about the same. We use the same evaluation protocol as Gemini and x.ai, and report scores\nusing a transparent bounding box.\n• ChartQA (Masry et al., 2022) is a challenging benchmark for charts understanding. This requires model\nto visually understand different kinds of charts and answer logical questions about the charts.\n• TextVQA (Singh et al., 2019) is a popular benchmark dataset that requires models to read and reason\nabout text in images to answer questions about them. This tests the OCR understanding ability of the\nmodel on natural images.\n• DocVQA (Mathew et al., 2020) is a benchmark dataset focused on document analysis and recognition.\nIt contains images of a wide range of documents which evaluates a model’s ability to perform OCR\nunderstanding and reason about the contents of a document to answer questions about them.\nTable 29 presents the results of our experiments. The results in the table show that our vision module attached\nto Llama 3 performs competitively across a wide range of image-recognition benchmarks at varying model\ncapacities. Using the resulting Llama 3-V 405B model, we outperform GPT-4V on all benchmarks, while\nbeing slightly behind Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Llama 3 405B appears particularly competitive\non document understanding tasks.\n7.7\nVideo Recognition Results\nWe evaluate our video adapter for Llama 3 on three benchmarks:\n• PerceptionTest (Pătrăucean et al., 2023) evaluates the model’s ability to answer temporal reasoning\nquestions focusing on skills (memory, abstraction, physics, semantics) and different types of reasoning\n(descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual). It consists of 11.6K test QA pairs, each with\nan on-average 23s long video, filmed by 100 participants worldwide to show perceptually interesting\ntasks. We focus on the multiple-choice question answering task, where each question is paired with\n61\n\nLlama 3-V 8B\nLlama 3-V 70B\nGemini 1.0 Pro\nGemini 1.0 Ultra\nGemini 1.5 Pro\nGPT-4V\nGPT-4o\nPerceptionTest (test)\n53.8\n60.8\n51.1\n54.7\n–\n–\n–\nTVQA (val)\n82.5\n87.9\n–\n–\n–\n87.3\n–\nNExT-QA (test)\n27.3\n30.3\n28.0\n29.9\n–\n–\n–\nActivityNet-QA (test)\n52.7\n56.3\n49.8\n52.2\n57.5\n–\n61.9\nTable 30 Video understanding performance of our vision module attached to Llama 3.

We report performance on the held-out test split which is accessed by submitting\nour predictions to an online challenge server.16\n• NExT-QA (Xiao et al., 2021) is another temporal and causal reasoning benchmark, with a focus on\nopen-ended question answering. It consists of 1K test videos each on-average 44s in length, paired with\n9K questions. The evaluation is performed by comparing the model’s responses with the ground truth\nanswer using Wu-Palmer Similarity (WUPS) (Wu and Palmer, 1994).17\n• TVQA (Lei et al., 2018) evaluates the model’s ability to perform compositional reasoning, requiring\nspatiotemporal localization of relevant moments, recognition of visual concepts, and joint reasoning\nwith subtitle-based dialogue. This dataset, being derived from popular TV shows, additionally tests\nfor the model’s ability to leverage its outside-knowledge of those TV shows in answering the questions.\nIt consists of over 15K validation QA pairs, with each corresponding video clip being on-average 76s\nin length. It also follows a multiple-choice format with five options for each question, and we report\nperformance on the validation set following prior work (OpenAI, 2023b).\n• ActivityNet-QA (Yu et al., 2019) evaluates the model’s ability to reason over long video clips to understand\nactions, spatial relations, temporal relations, counting, etc. It consists of 8K test QA pairs from 800\nvideos, each on-average 3 minutes long. For evaluation, we follow the protocol from prior work (Google,\n2023; Lin et al., 2023; Maaz et al., 2024), where the model generates short one-word or one-phrase\nanswers, and the correctness of the output is evaluated using the GPT-3.5 API which compares it to\nthe ground truth answer. We report the average accuracy as evaluated by the API.\nWhen performing inference, we uniformly sample frames from the full video clip and pass those frames into the\nmodel with a short text prompt. Since most of our benchmarks involve answering multiple-choice questions,\nwe use the following prompt: Select the correct answer from the following options: {question}. Answer\nwith the correct option letter and nothing else. For benchmarks that require producing a short answer (e.g.,\nActivityNet-QA and NExT-QA), we use the following prompt: Answer the question using a single word\nor phrase. {question}. For NExT-QA, since the evaluation metric (WUPS) is sensitive to the length and\nthe specific words used, we additionally prompt the model to be specific and respond with the most salient\nanswer, for instance specifying “living room” instead of simply responding with “house” when asked a location\nquestion. For benchmarks that contain subtitles (i.e., TVQA), we include the subtitles corresponding to the\nclip in the prompt during inference.\nWe present the performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B in Table 30. We compare Llama 3’s performance with\nthat of two Gemini and two GPT-4 models. Note that all our results are zero-shot, as we do not include\nany part of these benchmarks in our training or finetuning data. We find that our Llama 3 models that\ntrain a small video adapter during post-training are very competitive, and in some cases even better, than\nother models that potentially leverage native multimodal processing all the way from pre-training. Llama 3\nperforms particularly well on video recognition given that we only evaluate the 8B and 70B parameter models.\nLlama 3 achieves its best performance on PerceptionTest, suggesting the model has a strong ability to perform\ncomplex temporal reasoning. On long-form activity understanding tasks like ActivityNet-QA, Llama 3 is able\nto obtain strong results even though it is processing only up to 64 frames, which means that for a 3-minute\nlong video the model only processes one frame every 3 seconds.\n16See https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2091/overview.\n17See https://github.com/doc-doc/NExT-OE.\n62\n\nFigure 29 Architecture of our speech interface for Llama 3.\n8\nSpeech Experiments\nWe perform experiments to study a compositional approach of integrating speech capabilities into Llama\n3, resembling the method we used for visual recognition. On the input side, an encoder, together with an\nadapter, is incorporated to process speech signals. We leverage a system prompt (in text) to enable different\nmodes of operation for speech understanding in Llama 3. If no system prompt is provided, the model acts as\na general-purpose spoken dialogue model which can effectively respond to the user speech in a manner that is\nconsistent with the text-only version of Llama 3. The dialogue history is introduced as the prompt prefix to\nimprove the multi-round dialogue experience. We also experiment with system prompts that enable the use\nof Llama 3 for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). The speech\ninterface of Llama 3 supports up to 34 languages.18 It also allows for the interleaved input of text and speech,\nenabling the model to solve advanced audio-comprehension tasks.\nWe also experiment with a speech generation approach in which we implement a streaming text-to-speech\n(TTS) system that generates speech waveforms on-the-fly during language model decoding. We design the\nspeech generator for Llama 3 based on a proprietary TTS system and do not fine-tune the language model for\nspeech generation. Instead, we focus on improving speech synthesis latency, accuracy, and naturalness by\nleveraging Llama 3 embeddings at inference time. The speech interface is illustrated in Figure 28 and 29.\n8.1\nData\n8.1.1\nSpeech Understanding\nThe training data can be categorized into two types. The pre-training data includes a large amount of\nunlabeled speech, which is used to initialize the speech encoder in a self-supervised manner. The supervised\nfinetuning data includes speech recognition, speech translation, and spoken dialogue data; this data is used to\nunlock specific abilities when integrated with the large language model.\nPre-training data. To pre-train the speech encoder, we curate a dataset of approximately 15M hours of speech\nrecordings encompassing a large number of languages. We filter our audio data using a voice activity detection\n(VAD) model and select audio samples with a VAD threshold above 0.7 for pre-training. In speech pre-training\ndata, we also focus on ensuring the absence of PII. We use the Presidio Analyzer to identify such PII.\nSpeech recognition and translation data. Our ASR training data contains 230K hours of manually transcribed\nspeech recordings that span 34 languages. Our AST training data contains 90K hours of translations in\ntwo directions: from 33 languages to English and from English to 33 languages. This data contains both\nsupervised and synthetic data generated using the NLLB toolkit (NLLB Team et al., 2022). The use of\nsynthetic AST data enables us to increase model quality for low-resource languages. The speech segments in\nour data have a maximum length of 60 seconds.\nSpoken dialogue data. To finetune the speech adapter for spoken dialogue, we synthetically generate responses\n18The speech interface supports the following 34 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French,\nGerman, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Marathi, Persian,\nPolish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese.\n63\n\nfor speech prompts by asking the language model to respond to transcriptions of those prompts (Fathullah\net al., 2024). We generate synthetic data this way using a subset of the ASR dataset with 60K hours of speech.\nIn addition, we generate 25K hours of synthetic data by running the Voicebox TTS system (Le et al., 2024)\non subsets of the data used to finetune Llama 3. We used several heuristics to select a subset of finetuning\ndata that matches the distribution of speech. These heuristics include focusing on relatively short prompts\nwith a simple structure and without non-text symbols.\n8.1.2\nSpeech Generation\nThe speech generation datasets mainly consist of those for training the text normalization (TN) model and\nthe prosody model (PM). Both training data are augmented with an additional input feature of the Llama 3\nembeddings to provide contextual information.\nText normalization data. Our TN training dataset includes 55K samples that cover a wide range of semiotic\nclasses (e.g., number, date, time) that require non-trivial normalization. Each sample is a pair of written-form\ntext and the corresponding normalized spoken-form text, with an inferred sequence of handcrafted TN rules\nthat carry out the normalization.\nProsody model data. The PM training data includes linguistic and prosodic features extracted from a 50K-hour\nTTS dataset, which are paired transcripts and audios recorded by professional voice actors in studio settings.\nLlama 3 embedding. The Llama 3 embeddings are taken as the output of the 16th decoder layer. We work\nexclusively with the Llama 3 8B model and extract the embeddings for a given text (i.e. written-form input\ntext for TN or the audio transcript for PM) as if they are generated by the Llama 3 model with an empty\nuser prompt. In a given sample, each chunk in the Llama 3 token sequence is explicitly aligned with the\ncorresponding chunks in native input sequence for TN or PM, i.e., TN-specific text tokens (demarcated by\nunicode category) or phone-rate features respectively. This allows for training the TN and PM modules with\nstreaming input of Llama 3 tokens and embeddings.\n8.2\nModel Architecture\n8.2.1\nSpeech Understanding\nOn the input side, the speech module consists of two successive modules: a speech encoder and an adapter.\nThe output of the speech module is directly fed into the language model as token representation, enabling\ndirect interaction between speech and text tokens. Furthermore, we incorporate two new special tokens\nto enclose the sequence of speech representations. The speech module differs substantially from the vision\nmodule (see Section 7), which feeds multi-modal information into the language model via cross-attention\nlayers. By contrast, the speech module generates embeddings that can be seamlessly integrated with text\ntokens, enabling the speech interface to leverage all the capabilities of the Llama 3 language model.\nSpeech encoder. Our speech encoder is a Conformer (Gulati et al., 2020) model with 1B parameters. The\ninput to the model consists of 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram features, which are first processed by a stride-4\nstacking layer followed by a linear projection to reduce the frame length to 40 ms. The resulting features are\nprocessed by an encoder with 24 Conformer layers. Each Conformer layer has a latent dimension of 1536,\nand consists of two Macron-net style feed-forward networks with dimension 4096, a convolution module with\nkernel size 7, and a rotary attention module (Su et al., 2024) with 24 attention heads.\nSpeech adapter. The speech adapter contains about 100M parameters. It is composed of a convolution layer,\na rotary Transformer layer, and a linear layer. The convolution layer has a kernel size of 3 and a stride of\n2, which is designed to reduce the speech frame length to 80ms. This allows the model to provide more\ncoarse-grained features to the language model. The Transformer layer has a latent dimension of 3072 and a\nfeed-forward network with a dimension of 4096 which further processes the information from speech with\ncontext after the convolutional downsampling. Finally, the linear layer maps the output dimension to match\nthat of the language-model embedding layer.\n64\n\n8.2.2\nSpeech Generation\nWe use Llama 3 8B embeddings in two key components for speech generation: Text Normalization and\nProsody Modeling. The TN module ensures semantic correctness by contextually transforming written text\ninto spoken form. The PM module enhances naturalness and expressiveness by predicting prosodic features\nusing these embeddings. Together, they enable accurate and natural speech generation.\nText normalization. As a determinant of the semantic correctness of generated speech, the text normalization\n(TN) module carries out context-aware transformation from written-form text into the respective spoken form\nwhich is eventually verbalized by the downstream components. For example, the written-form text 123 is\nread as a cardinal number (one hundred twenty three) or spelled digit-by-digit (one two three) depending\non the semantic context. The TN system consists of a streaming LSTM-based sequence-tagging model that\npredicts the sequence of handcrafted TN rules used to transform the input text (Kang et al., 2024). The\nneural model also takes in Llama 3 embeddings via cross attention to leverage the contextual information\nencoded therein, enabling minimal text token lookahead and streaming input/output.\nProsody modeling.\nTo enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech, we integrate a\ndecoder-only Transformer-based Prosody model (PM) (Radford et al., 2021) that takes the Llama 3 embeddings\nas an additional input. This integration leverages the linguistic capabilities of Llama 3, utilizing both its\ntextual output and intermediate embeddings at the token rate (Devlin et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019; Raffel\net al., 2020; Guo et al., 2023) to enhance the prediction of prosody features, thus reducing the lookahead\nrequired by the model.\nThe PM integrates several input components to generate comprehensive prosody predictions: linguistic features\nderived from the text normalization front-end detailed above, tokens, and embeddings. The PM predicts three\nkey prosodic features: log duration of each phone, log F0 (fundamental frequency) average, and log power\naverage across the phone duration. The model comprises a uni-directional Transformer and six attention\nheads. Each block includes cross-attention layers and dual fully connected layers with a hidden dimension\nof 864. A distinctive feature of the PM is its dual cross-attention mechanism, with one layer dedicated to\nlinguistic inputs and the other to Llama embeddings. This setup efficiently manages varying input rates\nwithout requiring explicit alignment.\n8.3\nTraining Recipe\n8.3.1\nSpeech Understanding\nTraining of the speech module is done in two stages. The first stage, speech pre-training, leverages unlabeled\ndata to train a speech encoder that exhibits strong generalization capabilities across languages and acoustic\nconditions. In the second stage, supervised fine-tuning, the adapter and pre-trained encoder are integrated\nwith the language model, and trained jointly with it while the LLM stays frozen. This enables the model to\nrespond to speech input. This stage uses labeled data corresponding to speech understanding abilities.\nMultilingual ASR and AST modeling often results in language confusion/interference, which leads to degraded\nperformance. A popular way to mitigate this is to incorporate language identification (LID) information,\nboth on the source and target side. This can lead to improved performance in the predetermined set of\ndirections, but it does come with potential loss of generality. For instance, if a translation system expects\nLID on both source and target side, then the model will not likely to show good zero-shot performance in\ndirections that were not seen in training. So our challenge is to design a system that allows LID information\nto some extent, but keeps the model general enough such that we can have the model do speech translation\nin unseen directions. To address this, we design system prompts which only contain LID for the text to be\nemitted (target side). There is no LID information for the speech input (source side) in these prompts, which\nalso potentially allows it to work with code-switched speech. For ASR, we use the following system prompt:\nRepeat after me in {language}:, where {language} comes from one of the 34 languages (English, French,\netc.) For speech translation, the system prompt is: Translate the following sentence into {language}:. This\ndesign has been shown to be effective in prompting the language model to respond in the desired language.\nWe used the same system prompts during training and inference.\nSpeech pre-training. We use the self-supervised BEST-RQ algorithm (Chiu et al., 2022) to pre-train the speech\n65\n\nencoder. We apply a mask of 32-frame length with a probability of 2.5% to the input mel-spectrogram. If the\nspeech utterances are longer than 60 seconds, we perform a random crop of 6K frames, corresponding to 60\nseconds of speech. We quantize mel-spectrogram features by stacking 4 consecutive frames, projecting the\n320-dimensional vectors to a 16-dimensional space, and performing a nearest-neighbor search with respect to\ncosine similarity metric within a codebook of 8,192 vectors. To stabilize pre-training, we employ 16 different\ncodebooks. The projection matrix and codebooks are randomly initialized and are not updated throughout\nthe model training. The multi-softmax loss is used only on masked frames for efficiency reasons. The encoder\nis trained for 500K steps with a global batch size of 2,048 utterances.\nSupervised finetuning. Both the pre-trained speech encoder and the randomly initialized adapter are further\njointly optimized with Llama 3 in the supervised finetuning stage. The language model remains unchanged\nduring this process. The training data is a mixture of ASR, AST, and spoken dialogue data. The speech\nmodel for Llama 3 8B is trained for 650K updates, using a global batch size of 512 utterances and an initial\nlearning rate of 10−4. The speech model for Llama 3 70B is trained for 600K updates, using a global batch\nsize of 768 utterances and an initial learning rate of 4 × 10−5.\n8.3.2\nSpeech Generation\nTo support real-time processing, the prosody model employs a lookahead mechanism that considers a fixed\nnumber of future phones and a variable number of future tokens. This ensures consistent lookahead while\nprocessing incoming text, which is crucial for low-latency speech synthesis applications.\nTraining. We develop a dynamic alignment strategy utilizing causal masking to facilitate streamability in\nspeech synthesis. This strategy incorporates a lookahead mechanism for a fixed number of future phones and a\nvariable number of future tokens, aligning with the chunking process during text normalization (Section 8.1.2).\nFor each phone, the token lookahead includes the maximum number of tokens defined by the chunk size,\nresulting in variable lookahead for Llama embeddings but fixed lookahead for phonemes.\nThe Llama 3 embeddings are sourced from the Llama 3 8B model, which remains frozen during the training\nof the Prosody Model. The input phone-rate features include both linguistic and speaker/style controllability\nelements. The model training is conducted with a batch size of 1,024 utterances, each with a maximum length\nof 500 phones. We employ a learning rate of 9 × 10−4 using the AdamW optimizer, training over 1 million\nupdates with a learning rate warmup for the first 3,000 updates, following a cosine schedule.\nInference. During inference, the same lookahead mechanism and causal masking strategy are employed to\nensure consistency between training and real-time processing. The PM handles incoming text in a streaming\nmanner, updating the input phone by phone for phone-rate features and chunk by chunk for token-rate\nfeatures. The new chunk input is updated only when the first phone for that chunk is current, maintaining\nthe alignment and lookahead as during training.\nFor prosody target prediction, we employ a delayed pattern approach (Kharitonov et al., 2021), which enhances\nthe model’s ability to capture and reproduce long-range prosodic dependencies. This approach contributes to\nthe naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized speech, ensuring low-latency and high-quality output.\n8.4\nSpeech Understanding Results\nWe evaluate the speech understanding capabilities of our speech interface for Llama 3 on three tasks: (1)\nautomatic speech recognition, (2) speech translation, and (3) spoken question answering. We compare the\nperformance of our speech interface for Llama 3 with three state-of-the-art models for speech understanding:\nWhisper (Radford et al., 2023), SeamlessM4T (Barrault et al., 2023), and Gemini.19 In all the evaluations, we\nused greedy search for Llama 3 token prediction.\nSpeech recognition. We evaluate the ASR performance on the English datasets of Multilingual LibriSpeech\n(MLS; Pratap et al.

In evaluation, the decoding results are\npost-processed using the Whisper text normalizer to ensure consistency in comparing with the reported results\nof other models.

It demonstrates the strong performance of Llama 3 (and\nmulti-modal foundation models more generally) on speech recognition tasks: our model outperforms models\nthat are tailored to speech like Whisper20 and SeamlessM4T on all benchmarks. On MLS English, Llama 3\nperforms similarly to Gemini.\nSpeech translation. We also evaluate our models on speech translation tasks in which the model is asked\nto translate non-English speech into English text. We use the FLEURS and Covost 2 (Wang et al., 2021b)\ndatasets in these evaluations, measuring BLEU scores of the translated English. Table 32 presents the results\nof these experiments.21 The performance of our models in speech translation highlights the advantages of\nmultimodal foundation models for tasks such as speech translation.\nSpoken question answering. The speech interface of Llama 3 demonstrates remarkable question answering\ncapabilities. The model can effortlessly comprehend code-switched speech without any prior exposure to\nsuch data. Notably, although the model was trained only on single-turn dialogue, it is capable of engaging\nin extended, coherent multi-turn dialogue sessions. Figure 30 presents a few examples that highlight these\nmultilingual and multi-turn capabilities.\nSafety. We evaluate the safety of our speech model on MuTox (Costa-jussà et al., 2023), a multilingual\naudio-based dataset of 20,000 utterances for English and Spanish and 4,000 for 19 other languages, each with\ntoxicity labels attached. The audio is passed as input to the model and the output is evaluated for toxicity,\nafter cleaning some special characters. We apply the MuTox classifier (Costa-jussà et al., 2023) and compare\nthe results with Gemini 1.5 Pro. We evaluate the percentage of added toxicity (AT), when the input prompt\nis safe and the output is toxic, and the percentage of lost toxicity (LT), when the input prompt is toxic and\nthe answer is safe. Table 33 shows the results for English and an average across all 21 languages that we\nevaluated on.22 The percentage of added toxicity is very low: our speech models have the lowest percentage\nof added toxicity for English, with less than 1%. It removes significantly more toxicity than it adds.\n8.5\nSpeech Generation Results\nFor speech generation, we focus on evaluating the quality of token-wise input streaming models with the\nLlama 3 embeddings for the text normalization and prosody modeling tasks. The evaluation focuses on\n20On FLEURS ASR, Malayalam is not officially reported for Whisper v3, so we use the average of 33 languages.\n21On Covost 2, we evaluate only on 15 (out of 21) languages.\n22Note that for Gemini, we encountered that a significant number of responses were empty, which could be due to safety filters\non their side (though some empty responses were for non-toxic input) or to rate limits. To conduct the analysis, we assumed that\nall the empty responses are safe. This is the most conservative approach for results and the upper bound of what Gemini results\nwould look like.\n67\n\nFigure 30 Transcribed dialogue examples using the speech interface for Llama 3.

To measure the effect of Llama 3 embeddings, we experimented with changing the amount\nof right context the model uses. We trained the model using a right context of 3 TN tokens (demarcated\nby unicode category). This model is compared to models that do not use the Llama 3 embeddings, using a\n3-token right context or a full bi-directional context. As expected, Table 34 shows using the full right context\nimproves performance for the model without Llama 3 embeddings. However, the model that incorporates the\nLlama 3 embeddings outperforms all other models, hence enabling token-rate input/output streaming without\nrelying on long context in the input.\nModel\nContext\nAccuracy\nWithout Llama 3 8B\n3\n73.6%\nWithout Llama 3 8B\n∞\n88.0%\nWith Llama 3 8B\n3\n90.7%\nTable 34 Sample-wise text normalization (TN) accuracy.\nWe compare models with or without Llama 3 8B\nembeddings, and using different right-context values.\nProsody modeling. To evaluate the performance of the\nour prosody model (PM) with Llama 3 8B, we conducted\ntwo sets of human evaluation comparing models with and\nwithout Llama 3 embeddings. Raters listened to samples\nfrom different models and indicated their preferences.\nTo generate the final speech waveform, we use an in-\nhouse transformer based acoustic model (Wu et al., 2021)\nthat predicts spectral features and a WaveRNN neural\nvocoder (Kalchbrenner et al., 2018) to generate the final\nspeech waveform.\nFirst, we compare directly to a streaming baseline model without Llama 3 embeddings. In the second test,\nthe Llama 3 8B PM is compared to a non-streaming baseline model without Llama 3 embeddings. As shown\nin Table 35, the Llama 3 8B PM is preferred 60% of the time compared to the streaming baseline, and\n68\n\nModel\nPreference\nPM for Llama 3 8B\n60.0%\nStreaming phone-only baseline\n40.0%\nModel\nPreference\nPM for Llama 3 8B\n63.6%\nNon-streaming phone-only baseline\n36.4%\nTable 35 Prosody Modeling (PM) evaluation.

Right: Rater preferences of PM for Llama 3 8B vs. non-streaming phone-only baseline.\n63.6% of the time compared to the non-streaming baseline, indicating a significant improvement in perceived\nquality. The key advantage of the Llama 3 8B PM is its token-wise streaming capability (Section 8.2.2), which\nmaintains low latency during inference. This reduces the model’s lookahead requirements, enabling more\nresponsive and real-time speech synthesis compared to non-streaming baselines. Overall, the Llama 3 8B\nprosody model consistently outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the\nnaturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech.\n9\nRelated Work\nThe development of Llama 3 builds on a large body of prior work studying foundation models for language,\nimages, videos, and speech. A comprehensive overview of that work is outside the scope of this paper; we\nrefer the reader to Bordes et al. (2024); Madan et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2023a) for such overviews. Below,\nwe briefly outline seminal works that directly influenced the development of Llama 3.\n9.1\nLanguage\nScale. Llama 3 follows the enduring trend of applying straightforward methods at ever increasing scales in\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at scale.\nOpen source. Open weights foundation models have rapidly improved over the last year, with Llama3-405B\nnow competitive with the current closed weight state-of-the-art. Numerous model families have recently been\ndeveloped, including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), MPT (Databricks, 2024),\nPythia (Biderman et al., 2023), Arctic (Snowflake, 2024), OpenELM (Mehta et al., 2024), OLMo (Groeneveld\net al., 2024), StableLM (Bellagente et al., 2024), OpenLLaMA (Geng and Liu, 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023),\nGemma (Team et al., 2024), Grok (XAI, 2024), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\nPost-training. Post-training Llama 3 follows the established strategy of instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022;\nOuyang et al., 2022) followed by alignment with human feedback (Kaufmann et al., 2023). While some studies\nhave shown the surprising effectiveness of lightweight alignment procedures (Zhou et al., 2024), Llama 3\nuses millions of human instructions and preference judgments to improve the pre-trained model, including\n69\n\ntechniques such as rejection sampling (Bai et al., 2022), supervised finetuning (Sanh et al., 2022), and Direct\nPreference Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023). In order to curate these instruction and preference examples,\nwe deploy earlier versions of Llama 3 to filter (Liu et al., 2024c), re-write (Pan et al., 2024), or generate\nprompts and responses (Liu et al., 2024b) and apply these techniques through multiple rounds of post-training.\n9.2\nMultimodality\nOur experiments with multimodal capabilities for Llama 3 are part of a long line of work on foundation\nmodels that jointly model multiple modalities.\nImages. A substantial body of work has trained image-recognition models on large amounts of image-text\npairs, for example, Mahajan et al. (2018); Xiao et al. (2024a); Team (2024); OpenAI (2023b). Radford et al.\n(2021) presented one of the first models to jointly embed images and text via contrastive learning. More\nrecently, a series of models has studied approaches similar to the one used in Llama 3, for example, Alayrac\net al. (2022); Dai et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023c,b); Yang et al. (2023b); Ye et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023).\nOur approach in Llama 3 combines ideas from many of these papers to achieve results that are comparable\nwith Gemini 1.0 Ultra (Google, 2023) and GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI, 2023b); see Section 7.6.\nVideo. Although video inputs are supported by an increasing number of foundation models (Google, 2023;\nOpenAI, 2023b), the body of work on joint modeling of videos and language is not that large. Akin to Llama\n3, most current studies adopt an adapter approach to align video and language representations and unlock\nquestion-answering and reasoning about videos (Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Maaz et al., 2024; Zhang\net al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). We find that such approaches produce results that are competitive with the\nstate-of-the-art; see Section 7.7.\nSpeech. Our work also fits in a larger body of work combining language and speech modeling. Earlier joint\nmodels of text and speech include AudioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023), VioLA (Wang et al., 2023b), VoxtLM\nMaiti et al. (2023), SUTLM (Chou et al., 2023), and Spirit-LM (Nguyen et al., 2024). Our work builds\non prior compositional approaches to combining speech and language like Fathullah et al. (2024). Unlike\nmost prior work, we opt to not finetune the language model itself for speech tasks as doing so may lead to\ncontention on non-speech tasks. We find that at larger model scales, strong performances are attainable even\nwithout such finetuning; see Section 8.4.\n10\nConclusion\nIn many ways, the development of high-quality foundation models is still in its infancy. Our experience\nin developing Llama 3 suggests that substantial further improvements of these models are on the horizon.\nThroughout the development of the Llama 3 model family, we found that a strong focus on high-quality data,\nscale, and simplicity consistently yielded the best results. In preliminary experiments, we explored more\ncomplex model architectures and training recipes but did not find the benefits of such approaches to outweigh\nthe additional complexity they introduce in model development.\nDeveloping a flagship foundation model such as Llama 3 involves overcoming a plethora of deep technical\nproblems but also requires clever organizational decisions. For example, to ensure Llama 3 is not accidentally\noverfitted on commonly used benchmarks, our pre-training data was procured and processed by a separate team\nthat was strongly incentivized to prevent contamination of that pre-training data with external benchmarks.\nAs another example, we ensure that our human evaluations remain trustworthy by allowing only a small set\nof researchers who do not contribute to model development to perform and access these evaluations. While\nsuch organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the\nsuccessful development of the Llama 3 family of models.\nWe shared the details of our development process because we believe this will: (1) help the larger research\ncommunity understand the key factors of foundation model development and (2) contribute to a more informed\ndebate about the future of foundation models in the general public. We also shared preliminary experiments\nwith integrating multimodal capabilities into Llama 3. While these models are still under active development\nand not yet ready for release, we hope sharing our results early will accelerate research in this direction.\n70\n\nFollowing the positive outcomes of the detailed safety analyses presented in this paper, we publicly release our\nLlama 3 language models in order to accelerate the development of AI systems for a plethora of societally\nrelevant use cases and enable the research community to scrutinize our models and identify ways to make\nthese models better and safer. We believe that the public release of foundation models plays a key role in the\nresponsible development of such models, and we hope that the release of Llama 3 encourages the industry to\nembrace the open, responsible development of AGI.\n71\n\nContributors and Acknowledgements\nLlama 3 is the result of the work of a large number of people at Meta.
