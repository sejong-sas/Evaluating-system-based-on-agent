  "1-5 (Architecture)": "Llama 3 is offered as a \"herd\" of three multilingual transformer models containing 8 B, 70 B and 405 B parameters.  All variants follow a standard, dense Transformer design, and Table 3 in the source material enumerates their main hyper-parameters.  For the 405 B model those figures are spelled out: 126 decoder layers, a 16 384-dimension token embedding/hidden size and 128 attention heads.  The basic context window used during most of pre-training is 8 K tokens, but in a final training stage that window is dramatically enlarged to 128 K tokens.  Vision-augmented versions bolt on a ViT image encoder plus additional self- and cross-attention blocks; just the cross-attention layers account for ≈ 100 B parameters in the 405 B model, while the combination of video-aggregator and cross-attention layers adds 0.6 B parameters to the 7 B model and 4.6 B to the 70 B model.  Overall quality gains are attributed to both architectural scale and much larger compute budgets—e.g. the 405 B model consumed almost 50 × the pre-training compute that went into Llama 2-70B—yet, thanks to improved scaling laws, the 405 B variant still uses fewer parameters than older giants such as PaLM.",
  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "Llama 3 ships with a new tokenizer that is materially more compact than the one used in Llama 2: on a sample of English data the average number of characters represented per token rises from 3.17 → 3.94, indicating that the same text can be expressed with fewer tokens.",
  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The 405 B-parameter Llama 3 was trained at massive scale on up to 16 000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80 GB HBM3 each, 700 W TDP) deployed inside Meta’s Grand Teton AI server platform.  Each Grand Teton node contains eight H100 GPUs and two CPUs, and the cluster is tied together with RDMA-over-Converged-Ethernet (RoCE) networking built around Arista 7800 and Minipack2 OCP rack switches.  Even using BF16 precision, the full 405 B model cannot fit into the collective memory of a single eight-GPU server, so multi-node distributed training is mandatory.",
  "2-2 (Software)": "Training is implemented in PyTorch with Meta’s distributed stack.  Model, gradient and optimizer states are partitioned using Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP); unlike default FSDP behaviour, model shards are kept resident after the forward pass to avoid the extra all-gather normally required during back-propagation.  Collective communication is handled by NCCLX, Meta’s fork of NVIDIA NCCL optimised for the company’s infrastructure.  Jobs at the 16 K-GPU scale are launched and monitored through MAST, Meta’s global training scheduler.",

  ],
  "4-1 (Pre-training Data)": "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct is pre-trained on a markedly larger and more diverse corpus than earlier releases in the Llama family.\n• Size and language mix Several passages state that “We pre-train Llama 3 on a corpus of about 15 T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8 T tokens for Llama 2”, and that the 8 B and 70 B checkpoints were also pre-trained on a multilingual blend even though they were primarily intended for English use at launch.  Multiple quotes emphasise that the percentage of non-English material was deliberately increased, while English still remains the majority of tokens.  A specialised “multilingual expert” branch was created by resuming the run on a data mix that is “90 % multilingual tokens”, so that higher-quality non-English annotations could be collected.\n• Content composition tweaks During training the team “upsample[d] mathematical data”, “added more recent web data in later stages to advance the knowledge cut-off”, and “downsampled subsets … later identified as being lower quality”.  The mix was iteratively re-balanced whenever downstream evaluations indicated a weakness (e.g. multilingual reasoning) – a process described in the quotes as “Adjusting the data mix”.\n• Provenance, curation and contamination control A separate procurement team — “strongly incentivized to prevent contamination … with external benchmarks” — collected and processed the raw corpus so that benchmark leak-through would be minimised.  The paper also notes that “we improved both the quantity and quality of the data we use for pre-training and post-training” by introducing “more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines”.\n• Synthetic expansions for long context Earlier Llama 3 checkpoints were used to generate synthetic long-document question answering, summarisation and code-repository reasoning examples; these synthetic long documents themselves came from “our pre-training mix”.\n• Training run specifics (contextual for data throughput) One quote gives optimizer and throughput parameters for a 405 B variant (AdamW, peak LR 8×10⁻⁵, up to 8 M sequences of 8192 tokens) and another observes that “cross-attention layers … have ≈ 100 B parameters”.  Although these numbers refer to a larger sibling, they illuminate the scale of data pushed through the pipeline that also produced the 70 B checkpoint.\n• Memorisation auditing “Table 24” (verbatim) reports average memorisation rates “in pre-trained Llama 3”, signalling that the team measured how often the raw corpus appears verbatim in generated text.\nIn aggregate, the pre-training stage for llama-3.3-70b-instruct involved ~15 T tokens spanning web, code and domain-specific sources, a deliberate multilingual boost, math up-sampling, recent-web freshness, low-quality down-sampling, synthetic long-context additions, and strong safeguards against benchmark contamination.",
  "4-2 (Fine-tuning Data)": "Post-training for meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct follows a multi-round alignment pipeline built around supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO).\n• Two-stage development Quotes explain that after generic LM pre-training, “Language model post-training” aligns the model so that it follows instructions, behaves safely and acquires specialised skills such as coding and complex reasoning.\n• Core data sources The instruction-tuning sets are said to be “largely comprised” of (1) “prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses”, (2) “synthetic data targeting specific capabilities”, and (3) “small amounts of human-curated data”.  Millions of human-written instructions and preference judgements are mentioned explicitly.\n• Synthetic generation loops As stronger checkpoints emerge, they are recursively used to collect ever larger and more difficult datasets.  Earlier Llama 3 versions are prompted to fabricate long-context tasks — “question-answering, summarization for long documents, and reasoning over code repositories” — that feed into later SFT rounds.\n• Multilingual instruction tuning Separate quotes describe efforts to “source and generate high quality multilingual instruction tuning data for German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai”, complemented by training a dedicated multilingual expert model.  This multilingual SFT data is combined with English instructions so the aligned model performs in many languages even though the 70 B checkpoint primarily targets English usage.\n• Safety SFT Following the “Llama 2 recipe”, helpfulness and safety prompts are mixed, and a new “borderline dataset” teaches the model to recognise subtle differences between safe and unsafe requests.\n• Context-length adaptation Because the base model’s context window was extended from 8 K to 128 K near the end of pre-training, naïvely re-using short-context SFT data “resulted in significant regressions”.  Long-context samples therefore had to be added to the SFT mix.\n• Coding specialisation Quotes show the team “prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming language”, producing code datasets that are later filtered or scored (details in Section 4-4).  Overall, the fine-tuning corpus blends human-written, human-rated, synthetic and borderline safety material, covers many languages, includes special long-context and coding subsets, and is repeatedly expanded and cleaned in concert with stronger checkpoints and DPO rounds.",
  "4-3 (Reinforcement Learning Data)": "Reinforcement-style preference data underpins the DPO phase for meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct.\n• Collection protocol The paper notes that annotators engage in “multi-turn dialogues with the models and make comparisons among responses at each turn”.  Statistics for these comparisons appear in “Table 6”.  After each alignment round “multiple models” are deployed so that any single preference dataset does not over-fit to one checkpoint.\n• Pairwise and multi-turn comparisons For every user prompt, “two responses from two different models” are sampled and ranked — mirroring the methodology of Llama 2 but executed at larger scale.\n• Self-generation of reasoning traces The team “use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step solutions for a set of prompts”; generations are then “filtered based on the correct answer”.  This creates extra preference signals that reward valid chain-of-thought without leaking erroneous reasoning into the policy.\n• Scale An earlier quote in Section 4-2 emphasises that “Llama 3 uses millions of human instructions and preference judgments”, indicating that the reinforcement learning corpus itself is very large.  All of these comparisons feed into DPO reward models that in turn guide the policy updates for the 70 B instruct checkpoint.",
  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "A multilayer filtering stack is applied to both pre-training and post-training data for meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, with special attention to measurable quality, difficulty, safety and deduplication.\n• Classifier-based web cleaning “To train a quality classifier based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents … and instruct Llama 2’s chat model to determine if the document meets these requirements.”  Separate DistilRoBERTa classifiers for code and reasoning are “trained on web data annotated by Llama 2”.  Although the classifiers are distilled from a predecessor, they form the foundation for initial web-scale triage.\n• Quality scoring at post-training time Quotes state: “We use both reward model and Llama-based signals to obtain a quality score for each sample.  For an RM-based score, we consider data that is in the top quartile of RM scores as high quality.  For a Llama-based score, we prompt a Llama 3 checkpoint to rate each sample on a three-point scale (accuracy, instruction following, tone) for general English data and a two-point scale (bug identification, user intention) for coding data; samples that obtain the maximum score are retained.”  Hence, the pipeline explicitly expresses numeric cut-offs (top 25 % by RM; perfect 3/3 or 2/2 from Llama graders).\n• Difficulty scoring Because curriculum learning is desired, every retained example also receives a difficulty estimate.  Two metrics are used: Instag (a public automatic difficulty metric) and “Llama-based scoring”, so harder examples can be up-sampled.\n• Model-as-judge for code style and correctness “To address this, we utilise the ‘model-as-judge’ approach, where earlier versions of Llama 3 assign a binary (0/1) score on two criteria: code correctness and code style.  We retain only those samples that achieve a perfect score of 2.”\n• Self-verification of reasoning traces “We also do self-verification where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid … eliminating instances where the model does not produce valid reasoning traces.”\n• Safety and responsible-AI filtering “Our safety work begins in the pre-training stage, primarily in the form of data cleaning and filtering.”  Llama Guard 3, a safety filter, is itself improved via “extensive cleaning of the collected samples using human annotation as well as LLM annotation by Llama 3.”\n• Iterative filtering throughout alignment “In order to curate instruction and preference examples, we deploy earlier versions of Llama 3 to filter, re-write, or generate prompts and responses … through multiple rounds of post-training.”  The approach couples progressive dataset growth with repeated vetting.\nAcross stages, the system relies on Llama-family self-review, reward-model percentiles, binary pass/fail code judges, three-point and two-point rubric grades, Instag difficulty, and human/LLM safety screens.  Only examples meeting explicit numeric or rubric-based thresholds — e.g. top-quartile RM, perfect Llama rubric score, perfect 2/2 code score — survive to reach llama-3.3-70b-instruct’s final training sets.",
