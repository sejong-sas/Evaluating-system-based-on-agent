  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes specify that the model weights for meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct are openly hosted by Meta and mirrored on Hugging Face. One quote states: “This repository contains two versions of Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original `llama` codebase,” making clear that users can choose between a transformers-compatible format or the format used by the original `llama` tooling. A concrete download instruction is also given: “To download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging `huggingface-cli` … `huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct --include \"original/*\" --local-dir Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`.” Finally, the weights fall under the umbrella of the broader “Llama 3.3” release, which covers “trained model weights” that are “distributed by Meta at https://www.llama.com/llama-downloads.” Together, these sentences indicate that anyone can fetch the 70 B parameter instruct checkpoints directly from Meta’s official distribution point or via Hugging Face using the provided command, and that both a transformers-style and original-style weight format are offered.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "The code situation for meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct is summarized in several quotes. The definition of “Llama 3.3” explicitly includes “machine-learning model code, trained model weights, inference-enabling code, training-enabling code, fine-tuning enabling code and other elements of the foregoing distributed by Meta at https://www.llama.com/llama-downloads,” showing that pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference components are all part of the release. Practical usage examples are hosted in a public GitHub repository: “For more technical information about generation parameters and recipes for how to use Llama 3.3 in applications, please go https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes.” The weight repository itself “contains two versions of Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original `llama` codebase,” implying that the corresponding loaders / wrappers for both ecosystems are available. The quotes do not mention any private or withheld stages; therefore, all referenced training-enabling, fine-tuning-enabling, and inference code is considered publicly distributed by Meta within the scope of the “Llama 3.3” package and the linked `llama-recipes` cookbook.",
