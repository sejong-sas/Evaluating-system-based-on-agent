  "2-3 (API)": "The quotes repeatedly reference an officially branded \"Llama API\", linking directly to https://llama.developer.meta.com/join_waitlist. They indicate that an API endpoint exists (users can join a wait-list) and that Meta also supplies companion notebooks and other material showing “how to run Llama on your local hardware or in the cloud.” Taken together, the material confirms public documentation, a sign-up mechanism, and usage examples that accompany the Llama 3.3-70B family, demonstrating that an externally accessible service interface is offered in addition to local-run options.",
  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "Multiple notes highlight the arrival of an \"instruction-tuned\" release called \"Llama 3.3 70B.\" The announcement states that this model leverages “the latest advancements in post-training techniques” and explicitly supersedes the earlier \"instruction-tuned Llama 3.1 70B\" version. Supporting resources are provided through the \"Llama Cookbook\" which offers \"Notebooks and demos for learning Llama\" as well as \"Scripts for fine-tuning Llama3 with single/multi-node GPUs.\" Collectively, the quotes show that fine-tuning is expected and facilitated, with official scripts, multi-GPU scalability guidance, and a model card that reports detailed performance information for the new 3.3 70B checkpoint.",
