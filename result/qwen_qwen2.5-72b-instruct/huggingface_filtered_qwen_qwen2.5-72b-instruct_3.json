  "2-3 (API)": "The documentation for qwen/qwen2.5-72b-instruct explicitly includes an example that demonstrates programmatic access to the model. One sentence notes: “Here provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.” Immediately alongside, the code line `model_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct\"` is shown. From these two references we learn that (1) an illustrative snippet is supplied, (2) the helper utility `apply_chat_template` is employed for chat-style formatting, (3) the example walks the user through loading both tokenizer and model objects, and (4) generation can be triggered once those objects are instantiated. The explicit assignment of `model_name` to the exact string “Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct” confirms that the snippet targets the 72-billion-parameter instruction-tuned Qwen2.5 checkpoint, demonstrating a concrete, ready-to-run API usage pattern.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "Pre-training information is summarized in a single but informative statement: “**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 72B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features: – Type: Causal Language Models – Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training.” These sentences establish that (1) the 72-B Qwen2.5 weights were originally obtained through a causal language-model pre-training regimen, and (2) the model underwent both a large-scale pre-training phase and a subsequent post-training phase before being released. Although the excerpt does not list individual hyper-parameters or data specifics, it clearly places the model in the causal-LM family and confirms completion of the core pre-training workflow.",

  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "Two separate remarks outline the fine-tuning landscape for Qwen2.5. First, we are told: “For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters.” Second, it is reiterated that “**This repo contains the instruction-tuned 72B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features.” Collectively, these lines convey that (a) an instruction-tuning step was applied after base model training, (b) multiple parameter scales—spanning 0.5 B through 72 B—were produced via that process, and (c) the repository at hand specifically hosts the fully instruction-tuned 72-B checkpoint. Thus, the quotes confirm the existence of a systematic fine-tuning pipeline that generated and publicly released instruction-ready models across the entire Qwen2.5 size spectrum, culminating in the flagship 72-B variant.",
