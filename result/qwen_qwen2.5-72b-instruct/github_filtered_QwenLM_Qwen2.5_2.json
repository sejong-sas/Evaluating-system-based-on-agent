  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The only explicit architectural detail provided comes from two identical code-level references that set the default checkpoint path to \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\". From the literal text of the quotes we can state that the model variant under discussion is the 2.5 generation of the Qwen series and that the specific checkpoint carries the size tag \"7B\" and the suffix \"Instruct\", indicating an instruction-tuned release of that scale. Apart from the checkpoint identifier itself, the quotes do not spell out any further structural information such as layer count, hidden-size, attention heads, positional encoding type, or any other hyper-parameter. Consequently, the available architecture description is limited to (1) the official model family name “Qwen2.5”, (2) the parameter-scale label “7B”, and (3) the fact that it is an “Instruct” variant, implying it was adapted for instruction following. No other engineering or design details are present in the supplied material.",

  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "Tokenizer information is extremely sparse. The sole quote—\"model_name = \\\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\\\"\"—shows that the code expects to initialize or reference the model (and, implicitly, the corresponding tokenizer) via the same identifier used for the checkpoint. However, there is no direct statement about tokenizer type (e.g., BPE, SentencePiece), vocabulary size, special tokens, or whether the tokenizer files are released. All that can be stated with certainty from the quote is that any tokenization logic is expected to align with the model name \"Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\".",

  "2-1 (Hardware)": "No quotes mention GPUs, TPUs, CPU clusters, instance counts, memory sizes, or total training FLOPs. Therefore, there is no hardware information available for Qwen2.5 in the provided material.",
  "2-1 (Hardware)__evidence": [],
  "2-2 (Software)": "Two brief snippets are available: (1) the command line \"openllm serve qwen2.5:7b\", and (2) a docstring announcing a \"Qwen2.5 Speed Benchmark for transformers(pt) inference.\" From these we can infer that the model is integrated with the OpenLLM serving framework and that the PyTorch implementation of Hugging Face Transformers (denoted by “transformers(pt)”) is used at least for inference benchmarking. The presence of an explicit serve command suggests containerized or CLI-driven deployment through OpenLLM, while the benchmark string confirms that performance measurement scripts exist for the PyTorch backend. No further details—such as training framework versions, distributed training libraries, optimizer choices, or configuration flags—are disclosed in the supplied quotes.",
