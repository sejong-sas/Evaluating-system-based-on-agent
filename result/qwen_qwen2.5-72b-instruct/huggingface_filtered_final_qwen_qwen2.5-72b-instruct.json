Because the statement says the repo itself “contains” the model, the weights are not merely described but are actually present where the code lives, implying immediate availability to anyone with access to the repo.  No additional paywalls, gated requests, or separate distribution portals are mentioned in the provided sentences, so the only documented requirement for access is knowledge of the Hugging Face model path shown above.",

First, “The code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.”  This means that implementation support for Qwen 2.5—including model classes, configuration files, and inference utilities—has been merged upstream into the open-source `transformers` library rather than being limited to a private or proprietary repository.  Second, the team points readers to multiple public resources: “For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).”  These links indicate that a dedicated GitHub organization (“QwenLM/Qwen2.5”) holds additional code artifacts or examples, and that formal documentation is available.  The quotes do not explicitly separate pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, or RLHF scripts; they only confirm that the overall model code (at least for loading and inference) is open-sourced through `transformers` and further described in the affiliated GitHub repository and docs.",

Collectively, the quotes establish a model with 80 transformer blocks, a hidden size of 8 192, 64 attention heads (8 of which are key-value heads when using grouped-query attention), and approximately 72.7 billion trainable parameters, built with RoPE positional encodings, SwiGLU feed-forward gating, RMSNorm layer normalisation, and QKV bias in the attention mechanism.",

From these two references we learn that (1) an illustrative snippet is supplied, (2) the helper utility `apply_chat_template` is employed for chat-style formatting, (3) the example walks the user through loading both tokenizer and model objects, and (4) generation can be triggered once those objects are instantiated. The explicit assignment of `model_name` to the exact string “Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct” confirms that the snippet targets the 72-billion-parameter instruction-tuned Qwen2.5 checkpoint, demonstrating a concrete, ready-to-run API usage pattern.",
