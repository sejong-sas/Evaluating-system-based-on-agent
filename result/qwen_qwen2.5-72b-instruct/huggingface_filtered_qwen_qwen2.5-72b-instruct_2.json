  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The quotes describe the qwen/qwen2.5-72b-instruct model as “the instruction-tuned 72B Qwen2.5 model”.  They say it is a transformer architecture that incorporates RoPE positional encoding, SwiGLU activation, RMSNorm, and an Attention module that includes QKV bias.  Parameter counts given in the quotes state “Number of Parameters: 72.7 B”.  Depth is specified twice: once in prose (“Number of Layers: 80”) and again in the configuration snippet '\"num_hidden_layers\": 80,'.  Width-related hyper-parameters also appear in the config fragment: '\"hidden_size\": 8192,' and attention structure is clarified with '\"num_attention_heads\": 64,' together with a separate line that narrows the key/value sharing to '\"num_key_value_heads\": 8,'.  Collectively, the quotes establish a model with 80 transformer blocks, a hidden size of 8 192, 64 attention heads (8 of which are key-value heads when using grouped-query attention), and approximately 72.7 billion trainable parameters, built with RoPE positional encodings, SwiGLU feed-forward gating, RMSNorm layer normalisation, and QKV bias in the attention mechanism.",

A file named 'tokenizer.json' is enumerated, confirming the presence of a standard Hugging Face tokenizer JSON artefact within the model card or repository.  Altogether, the tokenizer is directly downloadable, has a 152 064-entry vocabulary, begins sequences with token ID 151 643, ends with token ID 151 645, and is fully compatible with the Hugging Face AutoTokenizer interface.",
