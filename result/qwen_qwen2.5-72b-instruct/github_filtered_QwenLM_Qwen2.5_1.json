  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes show that the QwenLM/Qwen2.5 checkpoints are openly published and can be fetched directly by path. Several snippets explicitly hard-code the download locations, e.g. “DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\"” and “model_name = \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\"”, demonstrating that anyone who passes this Hugging Face-style identifier to a loader can pull the model weights. Example command-lines confirm public availability for multiple sizes: “--model_id_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct” and “--model_id_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct”, implying that at least 0.5 B and 7 B parameter editions are served from the same namespace. The presence of benchmarking scripts (“Qwen2.5 Speed Benchmark for transformers(pt) inference.”) and arguments such as “--use_modelscope” and “--gpus 0” further suggest the weights can be obtained automatically by the scripts without any manual authentication barrier. A dated changelog line – “2024.09.19: We released the Qwen2.5 series.” – confirms an official public release event. Altogether, the evidence indicates that the model weights for Qwen2.5 are openly downloadable from the designated repository paths and are intended for general community use, with no mention of gated access or registration requirements.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "Only inference-time support code is referenced in the provided material. A multi-line docstring — “\"\"\"\\nQwen2.5 Speed Benchmark for transformers(pt) inference.\\n\"\"\"” — frames the script as a performance benchmark rather than a training pipeline. The accompanying command examples use the script to test FP16 decoding speed with different context lengths, GPUs, and back-ends (Transformers or vLLM). There are no quotes that expose training recipes, data-preparation scripts, optimizer schedules, or fine-tuning notebooks; therefore, we must conclude that, based on the supplied evidence, only inference/serving benchmarking code has been publicly released, while the full end-to-end training code (pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, RL, etc.) is not disclosed in these excerpts.",

Two identical reminders inside the demo, “Note: This demo is governed by the original license of Qwen2.5,” reinforce that any hosted interface or sample notebook inherits those same terms. Finally, the header comment “# Copyright (c) Alibaba Cloud.\\n# This source code is licensed under the license found in the\\n# LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.” gives standard provenance and points readers to the on-repo LICENSE document. Under Apache-2.0 the community receives broad grants for use, modification, redistribution, and commercial exploitation, provided they satisfy notice and attribution clauses and refrain from trademark misuse or patent litigation triggers. No additional restrictions such as ‘non-commercial’ or ‘research-only’ appear in the quoted text, so users retain full commercial and derivative rights consistent with Apache-2.0.",
