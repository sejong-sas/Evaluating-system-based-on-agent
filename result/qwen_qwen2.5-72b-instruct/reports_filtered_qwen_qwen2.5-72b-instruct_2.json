  "1-5 (Architecture)": "Qwen-family releases explicitly characterize all the open-weight variants—including the Instruct checkpoints—as dense, decoder-only language models.  Within the Qwen 2.5 line the size options are listed as 0.5 B, 1.5 B, 3 B, 7 B, 14 B, 32 B and 72 B parameters, and the flagship Qwen 2.5-72B (and its instruction-tuned sibling Qwen 2.5-72B-Instruct) is repeatedly highlighted as a 72-billion-parameter model whose “# Total Params” and “# Activated Params” are both 72 B—confirming that the network is fully dense rather than MoE-sparse.  A comparison table that places “Qwen 2.5-72B” next to “Qwen 2.5-Plus” and several non-Qwen baselines reiterates that only the Qwen 2.5 variant is Dense, while the larger comparative baselines adopt MoE routing.  The family’s context-window configuration is also stated: every Qwen 2.5 model can take prompts up to 128 K tokens long and can emit continuations up to 8 K tokens.  Another sentence notes that the dense layout of forthcoming Qwen 3 models is “similar to Qwen 2.5,” and spells out the internal building blocks shared with Qwen 2.5: Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), SwiGLU activation, Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), and RMSNorm with pre-normalization.  Although separate text lists older Qwen 2 checkpoints (0.5 B to 72 B) and their exact parameter counts, the consistent descriptor across all quoted Qwen 2.5 statements is a dense, decoder-only transformer offering a 128 K context window and fully-activated 72 B parameters at the high end.",
  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "The project card demonstrates usage through Hugging Face Transformers: `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\")` is the canonical call, indicating that the model’s tokenizer is published on Hugging Face Hub and can be instantiated via the generic `AutoTokenizer` interface without custom code.  No additional tokenizer internals are given, but the snippet confirms that the official tokenizer is downloadable alongside the checkpoints and integrates directly with standard Hugging Face tooling.",
