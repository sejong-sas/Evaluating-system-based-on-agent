  "1-1 (Weights)": "The project explicitly states that the weights for **Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct** are publicly downloadable. The quoted line “* 2025.6.27 We have open-sourced  **Hunyuan-A13B-Pretrain** , **Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct** , **Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct-FP8** , **Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4** on Hugging Face.” confirms that the base ‘Pretrain’ checkpoint as well as several instruction-tuned and quantised variants (FP8 and GPTQ-Int4) were released simultaneously on 27 June 2025. A command snippet shows the exact repository name --model tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct\\, establishing that the primary distribution channel is the Hugging Face Hub under that namespace. The file list excerpt (“model-00001-of-00033.safetensors” and the companion “model.safetensors.index.json”) indicates that the full-precision checkpoint is split across 33 *.safetensors shards with an index file, a conventional Hugging Face format that can be fetched by anyone who meets the licence terms. Taken together, the quotes demonstrate that the weights are openly hosted, versioned, and that multiple precision/format options are included for immediate use or further fine-tuning.",

Inside that repo a source file named “modeling_hunyuan.py” is highlighted and begins with the header “\"\"\" PyTorch HunYuan model.\"\"\"”, signalling that at least the model definition and inference utilities are available in PyTorch form. While the snippets do not explicitly enumerate the entire training pipeline, they confirm that core model code has been released. Therefore: (1) Inference/model-loading code is public, (2) the repository is located under the Tencent-Hunyuan organisation on GitHub, and (3) the implementation is specifically tailored for the Hunyuan-A13B family, making it directly usable with the tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct checkpoint. No sentence in the provided material claims that full pre-training scripts, RLHF pipelines, or data-generation code are shared, so only the availability of model implementation (and likely basic fine-tuning scripts) can be asserted on the basis of the quotes.",
