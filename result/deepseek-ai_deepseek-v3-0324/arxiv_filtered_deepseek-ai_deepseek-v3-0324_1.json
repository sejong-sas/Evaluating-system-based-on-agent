  "1-1 (Weights)": "The provided text explicitly confirms that the DeepSeek-V3 weights have been released to the public. The sentence “The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.” (repeated verbatim in two separate places) states the precise download location on GitHub, implying direct, unrestricted access. Surrounding statements describe DeepSeek-V3 as “the strongest open-source model currently available” and “the best-performing open-source model,” reinforcing that the checkpoints are openly distributed rather than gated or paywalled. No additional authentication steps, usage limits, or geographic restrictions are mentioned in the quoted material.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "None of the supplied quotes reference the release of DeepSeek-V3’s training code, data-processing pipeline, configuration files, or fine-tuning/RL scripts. Consequently, the excerpts give no evidence that any part of the training pipeline has been made publicly available.",
  "1-3 (License)": "No licensing terms—such as license names, version numbers, or restrictions on use, modification, redistribution, or commercial exploitation—appear in the provided quotations.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "The existence of an official publication is confirmed by the line “DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report.” Additional sentences say, “In this paper, we introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large MoE language model with 671B total parameters and 37B activated parameters, trained on 14.8T tokens,” and “In the remainder of this paper, we first present a detailed exposition of our DeepSeek-V3 model architecture (Section 2).” These statements show that a formal report or paper introduces DeepSeek-V3, provides architecture details in Section 2, and specifies key scale figures: 671 B total parameters, 37 B activated per inference, and 14.8 T training tokens.",
