  "1-5 (Architecture)": "DeepSeek-V3 is described as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer that contains 671 billion total parameters, of which 37 billion are actually \"activated\" for any given token. The model keeps inference economical by combining two proprietary design elements that first appeared in DeepSeek-V2 and are retained verbatim in DeepSeek-V3: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and the DeepSeekMoE routing architecture. MLA reduces key–value storage by using only a single KV head, while DeepSeekMoE provides cost-efficient expert routing. Under the default setup the system selects 8 routed experts, yet it can scale to as many as 13 experts (four nodes × 3.2 experts per node) without raising communication overhead. Structural tweaks inherited from V2 remain in place—a second RMSNorm layer is applied after the compressed latent vectors, and extra scaling factors are multiplied at the width bottlenecks. The design also introduces an auxiliary-loss-free load-balancing strategy and adopts a multi-token-prediction (MTP) training objective so that two future tokens are predicted at once. All of these choices fit within the standard Transformer framework and are reported to have been validated empirically during the V2 stage. Overall, the architecture yields a single, very large MoE LM (671 B/37 B active) trained on 14.8 trillion tokens while keeping both training and inference efficient.",
  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "The DeepSeek-V3 model is tokenized with a Byte-level BPE vocabulary extended to 128 K tokens, explicitly built for and shipped with the model.",
  "2-1 (Hardware)": "Training was carried out on a purpose-built cluster housing 2 048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs. Each compute node contains eight H800s linked internally via NVLink and NVSwitch, and the full cluster is stitched together with InfiniBand for cross-node communication. Efficiency statistics are provided: the end-to-end pre-training consumed 2.788 million H800-GPU hours; at the per-token level the team records just 180 K H800-GPU hours per trillion training tokens, translating to roughly 3.7 days for each trillion-token segment when the full 2 048-GPU cluster is engaged. These figures highlight the cost-performance benefits claimed for the DeepSeek-V3 architecture and training stack.",
  "2-2 (Software)": "All model training runs on the in-house HAI-LLM framework, which the authors call an \"efficient and lightweight\" solution built from scratch. Parallelism is heavily exploited: 16-way Pipeline Parallelism, 64-way Expert Parallelism spanning eight nodes, and ZeRO-1 Data Parallelism form the backbone of the distributed setup. Mixed-precision/accelerated kernels are employed, including FP8 training, to keep memory and compute budgets low. Optimization uses AdamW with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and weight_decay = 0.1. The baseline pre-training context window is 4 K tokens, with 14.8 T tokens consumed in total. After pre-training, a YaRN-based curriculum extends the context window through two 1 000-step phases, first to 32 K and then to 128 K tokens. Finally, the model is trained with a multi-token-prediction (MTP) head that predicts the next two tokens instead of one, further differentiating the objective from standard next-token training.",

  "2-3 (API)": "",
  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "DeepSeek-V3 undergoes an extensive pre-training phase that is repeatedly characterized in the source material as both massive in scale and carefully engineered for efficiency. The model is trained on 14.8 trillion “high-quality and diverse” tokens, a corpus that is explicitly optimized to increase the share of mathematical and programming content while also broadening multilingual coverage beyond just English and Chinese. Tokenization relies on a Byte-level BPE vocabulary expanded to 128 K tokens.  \n\nArchitecturally, DeepSeek-V3 is a 61-layer Transformer with a hidden size of 7 168. Although the total parameter count reaches 671 billion, the model follows a Mixture-of-Experts design in which only 37 billion parameters are activated per token. Several training innovations are highlighted: incorporation of the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) strategy, the use of FP8 precision, an auxiliary-loss-free load-balancing method for MoE routing, and a multi-token prediction objective.  \n\nThe optimization setup employs AdamW with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.95, and weight_decay = 0.1. Sequences of up to 4 000 tokens are processed during pre-training. Cost figures are given with unusual transparency: every trillion tokens consumes roughly 180 K H800 GPU-hours, so the full 14.8 T tokens require 2.664 million H800 GPU-hours—equivalent to about 3.7 days on a 2 048-GPU H800 cluster. The authors repeatedly emphasize that these efficiencies make DeepSeek-V3 “the currently strongest open-source base model.” Finally, the pre-training phase is presented as the first stage of a larger pipeline that will subsequently apply Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning to “fully harness” the model’s capabilities.",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "After the base model is trained, the DeepSeek-V3 team performs a dedicated post-training stage centered on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). They explicitly state that DeepSeek-V3-Base is fine-tuned for two full epochs on an SFT dataset under a cosine-decay learning-rate schedule that starts at 5 × 10⁻⁶ and decays to 1 × 10⁻⁶. A key goal of this stage is to align the model with human preferences while preserving a balance between answer accuracy and generation length.  \n\nThe fine-tuning pipeline also incorporates knowledge distillation: reasoning abilities are distilled from the DeepSeek-R1 model family into DeepSeek-V3, with the authors claiming a “success” in transferring these capabilities. Moreover, checkpoints produced during SFT serve as the initialization point for both the reward model and the subsequent reinforcement-learning stage. Preference data used for reward-model training is constructed to include not only final preference labels but also the chain-of-thought that leads to those preferences, signaling an intention to make the reward signal richer and more reliable. Collectively, these measures comprise a reproducible, well-specified SFT routine that prepares the base model for RLHF-style alignment.",
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "Reinforcement learning constitutes the final alignment layer for DeepSeek-V3. The authors describe a post-training sequence that combines SFT with RL “to align it with human preferences and further unlock its potential.” They adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an algorithm that dispenses with a same-size critic model and instead derives baselines from group scores, thereby reducing computational overhead compared with standard PPO-style methods.  \n\nThe reward model used during RL is itself trained from DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints, leveraging preference data that contains detailed chain-of-thought annotations. Beyond GRPO, the team applies a constitutional-AI style mechanism in which DeepSeek-V3’s own voting evaluations act as a feedback signal, broadening the sources of alignment feedback. Throughout the RL stage, the explicit objective is to fine-tune the policy so that model outputs better satisfy human and constitutional preferences while retaining the strong capabilities inherited from pre-training and SFT.",

  "4-1 (Pre-training Data)": "DeepSeek-V3 is pre-trained on 14.8 trillion high-quality and diverse tokens. Multiple passages repeatedly stress that the entire pre-training corpus contains “14.8T tokens” (or “14.8 trillion” tokens) and that these tokens are judged to be high quality and to come from diverse sources. Compared with DeepSeek-V2, the creators explicitly “enhance the ratio of mathematical and programming samples” and also “expand multilingual coverage beyond English and Chinese,” while simultaneously “assign[ing] more training tokens to learn Chinese knowledge.” In total, therefore, DeepSeek-V3’s corpus is not only larger but re-weighted toward mathematics, coding, and a broader set of languages, with special emphasis on additional Chinese data.  \nThe model’s tokenizer uses “Byte-level BPE … with an extended vocabulary of 128 K tokens,” and the paper notes that DeepSeek-V3 is a “large MoE language model with 671 B total parameters and 37 B activated parameters,” all of which are exposed to the same 14.8 T-token corpus.  \nFinally, the pre-training stage also “incorporate[s] the FIM strategy,” echoing the approach used in DeepSeekCoder-V2, meaning fill-in-the-middle sampling was part of pre-training. In short, the pre-training data strategy centers on a 14.8 T-token, quality-filtered, math- and code-enriched, multilingual corpus processed by a 128 K-vocabulary byte-BPE tokenizer, augmented with FIM sampling.",
  "4-2 (Fine-tuning Data)": "After the base DeepSeek-V3 model is trained, the authors run a post-training phase “including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).”  \n• Reasoning data: “For reasoning-related datasets, including those focused on mathematics, code competition problems, and logic puzzles, we generate the data by leveraging an internal DeepSeek-R1 model.” Separate lines re-affirm that these reasoning datasets are distilled from DeepSeek-R1 and that, during post-training, they “distill the reasoning capability from the DeepSeek-R1 series of models.”  \n• Non-reasoning data: “For non-reasoning data, such as creative writing, role-play, and simple question answering, we utilize DeepSeek-V2.5 to generate responses and enlist human annotators to verify the accuracy and correctness of the data.” The same point is made twice, underscoring that human verification is applied to the V2.5-generated answers.  \nThe reward model that will be used later for RL “is trained from the DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints,” so the fine-tuning data directly seeds both the alignment model and the reward model.  \nOverall, SFT data are a mixture of internally-generated reasoning samples (DeepSeek-R1 origin) and non-reasoning conversational/creative samples (DeepSeek-V2.5 origin, filtered by human annotators), all intended to align DeepSeek-V3 with human preferences before RL.",
  "4-3 (Reinforcement Learning Data)": "Reinforcement Learning follows SFT: “Following this, we conduct post-training, including … Reinforcement Learning (RL) on the base model of DeepSeek-V3, to align it with human preferences.”  \n• Reward model: “The reward model is trained from the DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints.” Another quote clarifies that the reward data “not only provides the final reward but also includes the chain-of-thought leading to the reward,” giving richer supervision signals.  \n• Algorithm: “Similar to DeepSeek-V2 … we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),” which removes the usual large critic; instead, a baseline is “estimated from group scores.”  \nThus, the RL dataset consists of preference pairs (with explicit chains of thought) that are scored by a reward model initialized from the SFT stage, and the policy is optimized with GRPO to further align DeepSeek-V3 with user preferences.",
  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "The paper provides several explicit statements about how data are filtered or left untouched for DeepSeek-V3.  \n1. Token retention: “Due to the effective load balancing strategy, DeepSeek-V3 keeps a good load balance during its full training. Therefore, DeepSeek-V3 does not drop any tokens during training.” A second sentence reiterates the same point that “DeepSeek-V3 does not drop any tokens.”  \n2. Corpus de-duplication / redundancy minimization: “Compared with DeepSeek-V2, we optimize the pre-training corpus … Also, our data processing pipeline is refined to minimize redundancy while maintaining corpus diversity.” The quote is repeated twice in the source, emphasizing redundancy removal as a filtering goal.  \n3. Vocabulary-level bias mitigation: The tokenizer “employs Byte-level BPE … with an extended vocabulary of 128 K tokens,” but this “may introduce the token boundary bias … when the model processes multi-line prompts.” To counteract that, the authors “randomly split a certain proportion of such combined tokens during training,” thereby exposing the model to more boundary cases and “mitigat[ing] this bias.” A second quote adds that the new pre-tokenizer “introduces tokens that combine punctuations and line breaks” and repeats the same random-splitting mitigation strategy.  \n4. Content re-balancing as implicit filtering: The same corpus-optimization quote notes that they “enhanc[e] the ratio of mathematical and programming samples” and “expand multilingual coverage,” which acts as a form of content-level filtering toward desired domains and languages.  \nConcrete criteria such as exact Jaccard or perplexity thresholds are not disclosed, but the authors explicitly state the following actionable filtering rules: (a) zero token dropping thanks to load balancing, (b) pipeline stages that de-duplicate to “minimize redundancy,” (c) tokenizer-level random splitting of a fraction of boundary tokens to combat bias, and (d) corpus re-weighting for math, code, and multilingual data.",
