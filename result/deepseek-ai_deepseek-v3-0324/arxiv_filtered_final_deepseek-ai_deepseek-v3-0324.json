  "1-5 (Architecture)": "DeepSeek-V3 is presented as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model that contains 671 billion total parameters, of which only 37 billion are activated for any given token. The model is built around two core structural ideas that were first validated in DeepSeek-V2—Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and the DeepSeekMoE routing scheme—and both are retained to deliver efficient inference and cost-effective training. To stabilize and scale the network, DeepSeek-V3 adds RMSNorm layers immediately after its compressed latent vectors and applies extra scaling factors at width bottlenecks. Communication overhead during training is controlled by a “device-limited” or restricted-routing policy that constrains expert traffic to local devices. In contrast to many earlier MoE designs, DeepSeek-V3 introduces an auxiliary-loss-free method for expert-load balancing, and its training objective is expanded from single-token to multi-token prediction to strengthen performance. Collectively, these design decisions yield a 671 B/37 B-active MoE that was trained on 14.8 trillion tokens and is positioned as both highly efficient and state-of-the-art among open-source models.",
  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "DeepSeek-V3 uses a Byte-level BPE tokenizer and extends its vocabulary to 128 K tokens, providing a unified sub-word representation that is fully compatible with the model’s large-scale multilingual training data.",
  "2-1 (Hardware)": "All pre-training and post-training phases of DeepSeek-V3 were run on a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs. Each cluster node houses 8 H800 cards interconnected by NVLink and NVSwitch, giving high intra-node bandwidth. Measured efficiency shows that every trillion tokens of pre-training consumes about 180,000 H800-GPU hours—roughly 3.7 days on the full 2,048-GPU system. End-to-end training (pre-training, context-length extension, and post-training) required a total of 2.788 million H800-GPU hours, a figure highlighted as markedly cheaper than training comparably capable dense models (e.g., 72 B or 405 B parameter baselines).",
  "2-2 (Software)": "Training is orchestrated with the in-house HAI-LLM framework, described as an efficient, lightweight system built specifically for DeepSeek-V3. Parallelism is hierarchically arranged: 16-way Pipeline Parallelism, 64-way Expert Parallelism spread across 8 nodes, and ZeRO-1 Data Parallelism, together enabling scalability to the full 2,048-GPU cluster. Computation is further accelerated with FP8 training kernels. Optimization relies on AdamW (β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, weight_decay = 0.1). Pre-training runs at a 4 K context window over 14.8 T tokens, after which YaRN is employed in two 1,000-step phases to grow the context size from 4 K to 32 K and finally to 128 K. For downstream alignment, the team adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), eliminating the need for a separate critic model by estimating baselines from grouped scores. Overall, the software stack combines custom framework engineering, multi-level parallelism, FP8 precision, YaRN-based context extension, and GRPO-based alignment to maximize throughput while controlling memory and communication costs.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "DeepSeek-V3 is initially pre-trained as a 671 B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model (37 B active parameters per token) that integrates Multi-head Latent Attention, DeepSeekMoE, extra RMSNorm layers and width-bottleneck scaling, an auxiliary-loss-free load-balancing strategy, and a multi-token-prediction objective.  The team builds a 14.8-trillion-token high-quality, diverse corpus whose composition is deliberately adjusted to contain more mathematics, programming and broader multilingual content than DeepSeek-V2.  Training is performed with a 4 K maximum sequence length and is reported as highly stable: each trillion tokens costs about 180 K H800 GPU-hours (≈3.7 days on a 2 048-H800 cluster) and the full 14.8 T corpus consumes 2.664 M H800 GPU-hours.  Counting later context-length and post-training work, the entire life-cycle totals 2.788 M H800 hours.  The result is claimed to be the strongest open-source base model available, rivaling leading closed models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet.",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "After pre-training, DeepSeek-V3 undergoes a multi-stage post-training pipeline.  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is run for two epochs on a curated dataset with a cosine-decay learning-rate schedule that begins at 5 × 10⁻⁶ and tapers to 1 × 10⁻⁶.  The SFT corpus is split by task type: reasoning data (math, code-competition, logic puzzles) are generated with internal DeepSeek-R1 models, whereas non-reasoning data (creative writing, role-play, general Q&A) are produced by DeepSeek-V2.5 and human-verified for correctness.  An additional distillation step explicitly transfers reasoning capability from the DeepSeek-R1 family while keeping a balance between answer accuracy and output length.  Context-window extension is applied with YaRN: two 1 000-step phases expand the model’s context length from the pre-training 4 K to 32 K and then to 128 K tokens, after which the model shows strong \"Needle-In-A-Haystack\" robustness across the full 128 K window.  Following the subsequent RL phase, rejection sampling with expert models filters and refines the SFT data so the final checkpoint preserves DeepSeek-R1 strengths yet produces concise, effective responses.",
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "Reinforcement Learning is the second half of the post-training cycle for DeepSeek-V3.  A reward model is first trained from the DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints.  Policy optimization then employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant that eliminates the need for a same-size critic by computing the baseline from group scores, thereby reducing compute overhead compared with traditional PPO.  For broader behavioral alignment the team also incorporates a Constitutional-AI style loop: DeepSeek-V3’s own voted evaluations supply feedback that guides further updates.  Collectively, the RL stage aligns the base model with human preferences and \"unlocks\" additional capability that is later consolidated through rejection-sampled SFT data.",

DeepSeek-V3 is trained with sequences up to 4 k tokens long, and all references underline that the same 14.8 T-token corpus is used in the model’s own tokenizer.  Thus, the publicly disclosed picture is: a single, very large (14.8 T) corpus, explicitly optimised for diversity, maths, coding and broader multilinguality, forms the entirety of the pre-training data from which the 671 B-parameter, 37 B-expert-active MoE model is learned.",

DeepSeek-V3-Base is then fine-tuned for two epochs on the resulting SFT mixture, using a cosine-decay learning-rate schedule that starts at 5 × 10⁻⁶ and drops to 1 × 10⁻⁶.  The authors frame the objective of the entire SFT corpus as balancing accuracy with adequate generation length while transplanting the reasoning power of DeepSeek-R1 into the new model.",
  "4-3 (Reinforcement Learning Data)": "Reinforcement Learning for deepseek-v3 begins after the SFT checkpoints are available.  A reward model is first trained “from the DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints.”  For the policy-optimisation stage, the team adopts Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), mirroring the recipe used in DeepSeek-V2.  GRPO discards the usual full-size critic network and instead estimates baselines from group scores.  The RL prompt distribution is deliberately broad, covering coding, math, writing, role-play and standard question-answering so that human-preference alignment spans multiple domains.  The paper also notes that constitutional-AI style feedback is injected by leveraging “voting” evaluations produced by DeepSeek-V3 itself, giving an additional automatic preference signal during longer-context development.",
  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "For deepseek-v3 the authors claim a refined data-processing pipeline whose chief aim is to “minimize redundancy while maintaining corpus diversity,” an explicit contrast with the previous DeepSeek-V2 pipeline.  One concrete cleaning step tackles a bias introduced by a new pre-tokeniser that fuses punctuation with line breaks: during training a random fraction of these combined tokens is split apart so that the model sees more varied special-token patterns.  Owing to an effective MoE load-balancing strategy, the team reports “No Token-Dropping” at all during the full training run.  After RL is finished, the project still performs an extra filtering pass for the SFT data: expert DeepSeek-R1 models generate candidate answers and “rejection sampling” is applied so that only high-quality responses—shorter, concise and effective—are kept for the final release set.  Collectively, these measures constitute the entire published description of filtering and cleaning for DeepSeek-V3.",
