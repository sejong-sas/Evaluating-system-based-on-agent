The sentence “This repository and the model weights are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).” explicitly states that the weights live in the same repository and are downloadable by anyone who can access the repo. A concrete shard name, “model-00001-of-000163.safetensors”, confirms that the full checkpoint is split across at least 163 *.safetensors files which can be pulled directly with no additional gating mechanism mentioned. No other distribution channel or restriction is described in the provided material, so the only information we have is that the weights are publicly present in-repository and covered by the MIT licence.",

The configuration metadata further labels the system with the identifier \"model_type\": \"deepseek_v3\", and lists its registered architecture under \"architectures\": [\"DeepseekV3ForCausalLM\"].  A dedicated configuration class—described as \"the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`DeepseekV3Model`]\"—is provided to instantiate the model and formally define its architecture.  Collectively, these statements confirm that DeepSeek-V3-0324 uses the DeepSeek-V3 family architecture, carries the explicit model type tag deepseek_v3, exposes a causal-language-model head titled DeepseekV3ForCausalLM, and relies on a standard configuration object to capture all architectural hyper-parameters.",

  "2-3 (API)": "The available information about the deepseek-v3-0324 API is limited to its temperature-handling logic. Two quoted statements specify that many users tend to supply a temperature of 1.0 when they invoke the model programmatically. To ensure that the model behaves with an empirically optimal randomness level, the deepseek-v3 implementation introduces a dedicated “API temperature mapping mechanism.” Concretely, whenever the external call includes a temperature value of 1.0, the system internally remaps that figure to an actual model temperature of 0.3. Therefore, \"if you call V3 via API, temperature 1.0 equals to the model temperature 0.3.\" This is the only documented API-side adjustment, and no further endpoints, authentication details, or example payloads are provided in the cited material.",

The hidden representation dimensionality is given as \"hidden_size\": 7168, indicating that every token is projected into a 7,168-element vector during forward and backward passes. Model depth is substantial, with \"num_hidden_layers\": 61 transformer blocks. Each layer employs a multi-head attention mechanism that is highly parallelized, featuring \"num_attention_heads\": 128 distinct attention heads per layer. Positional capacity is also emphasized by the very large \"max_position_embeddings\": 163,840, meaning the model can natively encode extremely long context windows without resorting to external chunking schemes. Collectively, these values outline the backbone of the deepseek-v3-0324 pre-training run, but the quotes do not mention data sources, token counts, training duration, optimizer choices, or learning-rate schedules.",

The configuration specifies a key-value LoRA rank of \"kv_lora_rank\": 512 and a query LoRA rank of \"q_lora_rank\": 1,536. This indicates that the fine-tuning pipeline replaces or augments full-rank parameter updates with efficient low-rank matrices of rank 512 for key–value projections and 1,536 for query projections, respectively. These figures suggest a strategy that balances parameter-efficiency with expressive capacity, but no further information—such as datasets, objectives, learning rates, or training steps—is provided in the extracted quotes.",
