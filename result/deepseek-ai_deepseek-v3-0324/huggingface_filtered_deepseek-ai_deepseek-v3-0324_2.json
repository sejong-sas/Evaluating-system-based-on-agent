  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The available material states that “The model structure of DeepSeek-V3-0324 is exactly the same as DeepSeek-V3.”  In other words, no architectural modifications were introduced for the 0324 checkpoint; it inherits the complete network design of the earlier DeepSeek-V3 release.  The configuration metadata further labels the system with the identifier \"model_type\": \"deepseek_v3\", and lists its registered architecture under \"architectures\": [\"DeepseekV3ForCausalLM\"].  A dedicated configuration class—described as \"the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`DeepseekV3Model`]\"—is provided to instantiate the model and formally define its architecture.  Collectively, these statements confirm that DeepSeek-V3-0324 uses the DeepSeek-V3 family architecture, carries the explicit model type tag deepseek_v3, exposes a causal-language-model head titled DeepseekV3ForCausalLM, and relies on a standard configuration object to capture all architectural hyper-parameters.",

No additional details (such as tokenizer type, special tokens, or download location) are provided in the current excerpts.",
