  "1-1 (Weights)": "The available evidence shows that the DeepSeek-V3-0324 repository actually hosts the checkpoint files themselves. The sentence “This repository and the model weights are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).” explicitly states that the weights live in the same repository and are downloadable by anyone who can access the repo. A concrete shard name, “model-00001-of-000163.safetensors”, confirms that the full checkpoint is split across at least 163 *.safetensors files which can be pulled directly with no additional gating mechanism mentioned. No other distribution channel or restriction is described in the provided material, so the only information we have is that the weights are publicly present in-repository and covered by the MIT licence.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "All quoted lines refer to the DeepSeek-V3-0324 model implementation itself. “The model structure of DeepSeek-V3-0324 is exactly the same as DeepSeek-V3.” clarifies that the released code mirrors the previously published DeepSeek-V3 architecture. Source files are ordinary PyTorch/Transformers modules, as illustrated by the header “# coding=utf-8\\n# Copyright 2023 DeepSeek-AI and The HuggingFace Inc. team. All rights reserved.”, the doc-string “\"\"\" PyTorch DeepSeek model.\"\"\"”, and the file name “modeling_deepseek.py”. These quotations prove that inference-time model definition code is public. No sentence mentions dataset loaders, pre-training scripts, fine-tuning pipelines or RLHF code, so the material only confirms public availability of the modelling/inference layer; training-stage code cannot be confirmed from the quotes supplied.",
