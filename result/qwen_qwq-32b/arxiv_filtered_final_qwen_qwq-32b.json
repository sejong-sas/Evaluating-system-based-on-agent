  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes for the weights category focus on the comprehensive range of dense Qwen2.5 models available with open weights. In the first quote, the Qwen2.5 series is detailed as comprising several dense models aimed at open source usage, with specific sizes ranging from very small (0.5B) to substantially large (32B and even 72B), along with additional MoE models (such as Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus) offered for API service. The inclusion of the 32B model in the list meets the target model filter requirement. The second quote further emphasizes that both base models and instruction-tuned models are available in these same sizes, including a quantized version of the instruction-tuned branch. It also mentions that over 100 different model configurations can be accessed through popular repositories like Hugging Face Hub, ModelScope, and Kaggle. Together, these quotes provide a detailed picture of a robust and diverse model portfolio with 32B as one of the key sizes available for open-weight research and application.",

  "1-3 (License)": "The license information provided is presented in a tabular format that begins with the token '32B', clearly meeting the target criteria. This entry indicates that for the 32B variation, several numerical parameters or specifications are provided (with adjacent values such as 64, 40/8, and 128K/8K), and crucially, it concludes with the mention of 'Apache 2.0', identifying the license under which this model is distributed. The Apache 2.0 license is well-known for its permissive nature, typically allowing modification, redistribution, and both commercial and non-commercial use under specified conditions. Though the numeric details are not elaborated upon in a narrative style, the explicit inclusion of Apache 2.0 alongside the '32B' token clearly indicates the licensing terms tied to this particular model version, fulfilling the requirement to detail the license aspects using the provided quote.",
