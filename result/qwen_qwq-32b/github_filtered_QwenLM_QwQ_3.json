  "2-3 (API)": "The material explicitly opens with \"## Try QwQ with API\", signalling official support for remote access. Users are told, \"If you face issues in deploying QwQ, we encourage you to test our API service provided by [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/developer-reference/what-is-qwen-llm).\"  Concrete invocation guidance is supplied via a code snippet: \"parser.add_argument(\"--model_name\", type=str, default='Qwen/QwQ-32B', help=\"model name of vllm server\")\", which designates the served endpoint’s model identifier. A further call example demonstrates the request path and model tag: \"res = get_content(user_input, \\\"http://10.77.249.36:8030/v1\\\", \\\"Qwen/QwQ\\\")\". Together these quotations establish that a publicly reachable API is offered through Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, and they illustrate parameter and URL formats for issuing inference queries to the QwQ model.",
