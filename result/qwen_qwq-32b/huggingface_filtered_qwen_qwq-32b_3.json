  "2-3 (API)": "The only explicit information provided about an API for the QwQ 32B family is the statement: “You can try our demo … or access QwQ models via QwenChat.”  From this single sentence we can extract all presently available details.  First, it confirms that a public, hands-on interface exists in the form of a Hugging Face Space titled “QwQ-32B-Demo,” implying that the demo runs an instance of the QwQ 32B model and can be reached through a web browser.  Second, it tells us that the same model (and presumably other QwQ variants) can also be reached through the proprietary ‘QwenChat’ service at chat.qwen.ai.  Together, these two access points constitute the project’s publicly advertised API surface: a hosted conversational playground on Hugging Face and an official chat-oriented endpoint branded as QwenChat.  No additional information—such as authentication, rate limits, SDKs, or usage examples—is present in the quote, so our understanding is limited strictly to the existence of these two publicly facing routes for interacting with QwQ 32B.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The pre-training story for QwQ 32B is conveyed entirely through the declaration: “**This repo contains the QwQ 32B model**, which has the following features:  ‑ Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training (Supervised Finetuning and Reinforcement Learning).”  From this we know, first and foremost, that the repository actually ships the 32-billion-parameter variant called QwQ 32B, and second, that its development lifecycle explicitly included a ‘Pretraining’ phase.  Although the snippet does not enumerate datasets, token counts, compute budgets, or optimization hyper-parameters, it unambiguously places pre-training at the foundation of the model’s overall training stack.  In other words, QwQ 32B was not trained solely through task-specific fine-tuning; rather, it underwent a large-scale, general-purpose pre-training step before any subsequent post-training procedures.  The same sentence also hints that this pre-training is tightly coupled with later stages—Supervised Finetuning and Reinforcement Learning—suggesting an integrated pipeline, but the quote provides no further technical breakdown of the pre-training methodology itself.",

  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "Supervised fine-tuning for QwQ 32B is referenced in the same core statement: “**This repo contains the QwQ 32B model**, which has the following features:  ‑ Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training (Supervised Finetuning and Reinforcement Learning).”  Here, ‘post-training’ is explicitly divided into two parts, the first of which is Supervised Finetuning.  Consequently, we can assert that after the initial pre-training pass, the QwQ 32B weights were further refined with a supervised objective—most likely leveraging curated instruction or task data—before entering any reinforcement-learning phase.  The sentence confirms the existence of this step but omits specifics such as dataset composition, loss functions, hyper-parameters, or evaluation checkpoints.  Still, the inclusion of Supervised Finetuning in the official training stage list establishes that QwQ 32B’s final capability set is the product of a deliberate two-stage refinement: (1) generic pre-training and (2) task-guided supervised adjustment, executed prior to the RL stage described separately.",

  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "The same authoritative snippet—“**This repo contains the QwQ 32B model**, which has the following features:  ‑ Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training (Supervised Finetuning and Reinforcement Learning)”—also explicitly cites Reinforcement Learning as part of the post-training regime.  This tells us that after Supervised Finetuning, QwQ 32B was further optimized through a reinforcement-learning procedure (the quote does not specify whether it was RLHF, PPO, DPO, or another variant, only that RL was used).  The listing positions reinforcement learning alongside supervised fine-tuning under the larger umbrella of ‘Post-training,’ indicating a sequential or complementary process that fine-tunes the model’s behavior based on feedback or preference signals.  Beyond confirming its existence, the excerpt does not expose reward models, policy-optimization algorithms, or hyper-parameters, but it makes clear that reinforcement learning forms an integral, officially documented stage in the creation of QwQ 32B.",
