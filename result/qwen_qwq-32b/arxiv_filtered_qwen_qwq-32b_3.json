  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The project documentation explicitly states that a 32 B-parameter variant is part of the Qwen2.5 family released as open weights. The authors describe the series as offering “rich configurations,” listing the exact sizes—0.5 B, 1.5 B, 3 B, 7 B, 14 B, 32 B, and 72 B—for both base and instruction-tuned checkpoints. They further clarify that these checkpoints are provided as dense models for open-source use (e.g., “Qwen2.5-32B”), while separate MoE models (Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus) are reserved for API service. Although no additional hyper-parameters or data-flow details are included in the quoted text, the passages confirm the existence and public release of a fully pre-trained, dense 32 B model within the Qwen2.5 lineup.",
