It has been developed for both pretraining and post-training phases, which include supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Key architectural specifications include a total of 32.5 billion parameters (with 31.0 billion non-embedding parameters), 64 layers, and specialized multi-head attention where heads are divided into 40 for query and 8 for key/value (in a grouped attention setup). Additionally, the model is capable of processing a context length of up to 131,072 tokens, making it highly scalable for tasks requiring extensive sequential input.",
