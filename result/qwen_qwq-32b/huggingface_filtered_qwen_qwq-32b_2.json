  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The QwQ 32B model is detailed as a causal language model utilizing a transformer architecture enhanced with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and an Attention QKV bias. It has been developed for both pretraining and post-training phases, which include supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Key architectural specifications include a total of 32.5 billion parameters (with 31.0 billion non-embedding parameters), 64 layers, and specialized multi-head attention where heads are divided into 40 for query and 8 for key/value (in a grouped attention setup). Additionally, the model is capable of processing a context length of up to 131,072 tokens, making it highly scalable for tasks requiring extensive sequential input.",
