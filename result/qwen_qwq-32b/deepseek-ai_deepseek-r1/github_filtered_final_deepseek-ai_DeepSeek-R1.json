This indicates that the architectural foundation and training design for DeepSeek-R1, along with its variant DeepSeek-R1-Zero, directly derives from the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. In this context, the quote suggests that key architectural decisions and strategies, although not detailed further, are inherited from DeepSeek-V3-Base, implying that aspects such as layer configuration, structural design, and hyperparameters might be adapted or built upon the established framework of DeepSeek-V3-Base.",
