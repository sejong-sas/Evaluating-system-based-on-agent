  "4-2 (Fine-tuning Data)": "The provided quote explains that for DeepSeek-R1, a small amount of long chain-of-thought (CoT) data is carefully constructed and collected to fine-tune the model as the initial reinforcement learning actor. This targeted fine-tuning strategy is introduced to avoid the early unstable cold start phase experienced by the base model and is positioned in contrast to methods like those used in DeepSeek-R1-Zero.",
  "4-3 (Reinforcement Learning Data)": "The quote indicates that the current availability of reinforcement learning training data for DeepSeek-R1 is very limited. It also suggests an anticipation that with future iterations or the next version, the engineering performance of DeepSeek-R1 may improve as more RL training data becomes available, thereby positively impacting the model's capabilities.",
  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "The quote outlines a data filtering approach specific to the creation of cold-start data for DeepSeek-R1. A readable pattern is designed that incorporates a summary at the end of each response and actively filters out responses that are not reader-friendly. This method focuses on ensuring that the final outputs are both coherent and easily accessible for readers.",
