  "2-3 (API)": "The quotes indicate that the DeepSeek-R1 model provides an accessible API that is open source. This API is highlighted as a resource for the research community, with the potential to aid in distilling smaller, improved models in the future.",
  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "The provided quotes explain that DeepSeek-R1 is integrated into a multi-stage training pipeline that includes fine-tuning with a small amount of cold-start data. They further detail the use of reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1 to fine-tune several dense models, and note that DeepSeek-R1 itself functions as a teacher model generating 800K training samples for the fine-tuning process of smaller dense models.",
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "The quotes reveal that reinforcement learning (RL) plays a significant role in the development of DeepSeek-R1 and its variant, DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero is described as undergoing thousands of RL steps and achieving strong reasoning performance without supervised fine-tuning, emphasizing a pure RL approach without reliance on cold-start data. Additionally, one quote points out that DeepSeek-R1, when compared to a later version (DeepSeek-V3), suffers from reduced performance on specific benchmarks, partially due to its tendency to refuse answering certain queries after safety-oriented RL adjustments.",
