  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "No quotes include any explicit reference to the pre-training methodology with tokens such as deepseek or deepseekr1. Therefore, there is no information provided regarding pre-training procedures, data flow, or hyperparameter settings.",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "The provided quote details a fine-tuning process where, after using new data for fine-tuning, the checkpoint underwent an additional reinforcement learning step that incorporated prompts from a variety of scenarios. This process resulted in a checkpoint explicitly referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which is noted to achieve performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217, thereby highlighting the success of the fine-tuning and subsequent RL integration.",
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "The available quotes describe a reinforcement learning strategy centered on the DeepSeek-R1-Zero model. This model was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning without any preceding supervised fine-tuning, thereby emphasizing its remarkable reasoning capabilities. The training methodology employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a technique that avoids using a critic model of equivalent size to the policy model by estimating a baseline from group scores. Together, these details provide an in-depth look at the RL process implemented for the DeepSeek-R1-Zero model.",
