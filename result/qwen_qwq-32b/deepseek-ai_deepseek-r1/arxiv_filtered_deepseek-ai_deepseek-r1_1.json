  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quote reveals that to support the research community, the model weights for DeepSeek-R1 have been fully open-sourced. The available weights include both DeepSeek-R1 and an associated variant called DeepSeek-R1-Zero, along with six dense models covering a range of sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B). These dense models were distilled from DeepSeek-R1 and are based on architectures from Qwen and Llama, highlighting the extensive range and derivation of the released models.",

  "1-4 (Paper)": "The provided information includes a reference to an official document associated with DeepSeek-R1. It mentions the benchmark performance presented in 'Figure 1' as documented in an arXiv paper with the identifier arXiv:2501.12948v1, dated 22 Jan 2025. This suggests that benchmarking and performance analysis details are available in the research literature.",
