The available weights include both DeepSeek-R1 and an associated variant called DeepSeek-R1-Zero, along with six dense models covering a range of sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B). These dense models were distilled from DeepSeek-R1 and are based on architectures from Qwen and Llama, highlighting the extensive range and derivation of the released models.",

This model was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning without any preceding supervised fine-tuning, thereby emphasizing its remarkable reasoning capabilities. The training methodology employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a technique that avoids using a critic model of equivalent size to the policy model by estimating a baseline from group scores. Together, these details provide an in-depth look at the RL process implemented for the DeepSeek-R1-Zero model.",

In contrast to the DeepSeek-R1-Zero approach, this dataset is designed to serve as a stabilizing initial point by fine-tuning either the DeepSeek-V3-Base model or the model directly as the initial RL actor. This method aims at mitigating the cold start phase instability by providing a more robust foundation for subsequent RL training processes.",
