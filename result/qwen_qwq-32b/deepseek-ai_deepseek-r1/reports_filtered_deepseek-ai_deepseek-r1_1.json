{
  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes explicitly mention that DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero, along with six additional dense models (sized 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B), have been open-sourced to support the research community. These models are distilled from DeepSeek-R1 using methodologies based on Qwen and Llama, highlighting the availability of model weights for research and further exploration.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "No information regarding public training code, inference pipelines, or other code-based resources for DeepSeek-R1 is provided in the quotes.",
  "1-3 (License)": "There is no license-related information provided in the quotes, so details about usage rights, modifications, redistribution, or commercial use are not available.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "The quotes consistently refer to an official paper titled 'DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning'. This paper appears to be the primary technical resource associated with DeepSeek-R1, focusing on the reinforcement learning techniques used to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities.",
