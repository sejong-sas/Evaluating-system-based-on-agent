  "1-1 (Weights)": "The available quotes provide clear evidence that the model weights for deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3 are publicly released. Two identical sentences explicitly state: “The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.”  In addition, several sentences emphasize that DeepSeek-V3 is positioned as an “open-source model,” including: “DeepSeek-V3 stands as the best-performing open-source model,” and “Overall, DeepSeek-V3-Base comprehensively outperforms DeepSeek-V2-Base and Qwen2.5 72B Base, and surpasses LLaMA-3.1 405B Base in the majority of benchmarks, essentially becoming the strongest open-source model.”  Because the checkpoints are explicitly hosted on GitHub and repeatedly described as open-source, the quotes together confirm that anyone can obtain the weights by downloading the checkpoints from that GitHub repository.",

  "1-4 (Paper)": "The supplied excerpts indicate the existence of an official technical document for deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3.  One quote explicitly references “DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report,” signaling that a formal report has been published.  Multiple sentences confirm it is indeed a paper: “In the remainder of this paper, we first present a detailed exposition of our DeepSeek-V3 model architecture (Section 2),” and “In this paper, we introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large MoE language model with 671 B total parameters and 37 B activated parameters, trained on 14.8 T tokens.”  Collectively, these quotes establish that an official paper or technical report exists, provides architectural details in Section 2, and describes DeepSeek-V3 as a 671-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 37 B active parameters per token trained on 14.8 trillion tokens.",
