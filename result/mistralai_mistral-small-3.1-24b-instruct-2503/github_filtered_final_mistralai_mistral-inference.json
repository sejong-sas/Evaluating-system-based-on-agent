  "1-1 (Weights)": "The documentation explicitly states that end-users can obtain binary checkpoints for Mistral models from Hugging Face. A concrete example is given: “For Hugging Face models' weights, here is an example to download [Mistral Small 3.1 24B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503).”  The use of a public Hugging Face URL indicates open, direct HTTP / `huggingface-cli` download capability (no gated approval call-outs are mentioned in the quote).  In addition, the maintainers note that archival checkpoints remain accessible: “You can download the previous versions of our models from our [docs](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/open_weight_models/#downloading).”  Together these quotes make it clear that (i) at least one concrete model file is published openly, (ii) there is a central documentation page collecting historical releases, and (iii) the standard retrieval workflow is a self-service download rather than a request-only procedure.  No quote mentions any paywall or authentication step, so, by default, the weights appear to be publicly downloadable by anyone who consults the links provided.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "Two sentences describe the publicly available codebase and its purpose.  First: “This repository contains minimal code to run Mistral models.”  This indicates that at least inference / serving helpers are shipped.  Second: “The `deploy` folder contains code to build a [vLLM](https://M7B_DIR.com/vllm-project/vllm) image with the required dependencies to serve the Mistral AI model.”  The wording highlights that container-level artifacts (Dockerfile or similar) are included to generate a vLLM image, implying that the repository covers environment setup, dependency pinning, and launch scripts for production or benchmark inference.  There is no direct statement that full pre-training or fine-tuning pipelines are open; the quotes only guarantee code for ‘run’ and ‘serve’.  Consequently, the public code scope is limited to inference/serving, while training-time assets (data preprocessing, optimizer schedules, RLHF loops, etc.) are not confirmed.",

  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The only disclosed architectural elements for mistralai/mistral-inference are that its Transformer implementation imports and therefore relies on two specific layer classes located in the package module `mistral_inference.transformer_layers`: `RMSNorm` (for root-mean-square layer normalisation) and `TransformerBlock` (the composite block containing attention/MLP sub-layers).

The tokenizer is obtained from a local file path rather than an online hub, e.g. `MistralTokenizer.from_file(\"./mistral-nemo-instruct-v0.1/tekken.json\")`. Other examples show the same class being initialised from `model_path / tokenizer[0]` or via a helper `load_tokenizer(Path(model_path))`. One line accesses the underlying raw tokenizer object through `mistral_tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer`. Collectively, these lines confirm that mistralai/mistral-inference uses the custom `MistralTokenizer`, can load it from extracted JSON files, and supports an “instruct” variant.",

  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The documentation states that “you will use a GPU” when installing `mistral-inference`, because its dependency `xformers` itself requires a GPU for compilation.
