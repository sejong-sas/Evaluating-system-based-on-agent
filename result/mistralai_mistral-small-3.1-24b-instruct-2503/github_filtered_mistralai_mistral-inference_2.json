  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The only disclosed architectural elements for mistralai/mistral-inference are that its Transformer implementation imports and therefore relies on two specific layer classes located in the package module `mistral_inference.transformer_layers`: `RMSNorm` (for root-mean-square layer normalisation) and `TransformerBlock` (the composite block containing attention/MLP sub-layers). No other depth, width, or hyper-parameter details are revealed in the provided material.",

  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "All snippet references load a `MistralTokenizer`. The tokenizer is obtained from a local file path rather than an online hub, e.g. `MistralTokenizer.from_file(\"./mistral-nemo-instruct-v0.1/tekken.json\")`. Other examples show the same class being initialised from `model_path / tokenizer[0]` or via a helper `load_tokenizer(Path(model_path))`. One line accesses the underlying raw tokenizer object through `mistral_tokenizer.instruct_tokenizer.tokenizer`. Collectively, these lines confirm that mistralai/mistral-inference uses the custom `MistralTokenizer`, can load it from extracted JSON files, and supports an “instruct” variant.",

  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The documentation states that “you will use a GPU” when installing `mistral-inference`, because its dependency `xformers` itself requires a GPU for compilation. Thus, at minimum a CUDA-capable GPU is necessary for environment setup (and, by implication, for running or potentially training the model), but no further quantities or chip models are specified.",

  ],
  "2-2 (Software)": "The only training-related software hint is that installing `mistral-inference` mandates the additional library `xformers`. While this note is phrased in the context of installation rather than explicit training, it establishes that the codebase is coupled with the `xformers` acceleration stack, which in turn depends on GPU-enabled builds. No other frameworks, distributed-training libraries, or optimizer details are mentioned in the supplied text.",
