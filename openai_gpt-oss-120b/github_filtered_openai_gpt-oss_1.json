  "1-1 (Weights)": "The provided excerpts make it clear that the weights for the target model family are openly downloadable. A headline explicitly instructs users to “Download https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b and https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b on Hugging Face,” and a follow-up sentence reiterates that “You can download the model weights from the [Hugging Face Hub] … directly from Hugging Face CLI.” These quotes confirm both (a) public availability and (b) the canonical hosting location (the Hugging Face Hub). They also imply multiple checkpoints—at least the 120-billion-parameter and 20-billion-parameter variants—are posted in the same collection (“openai/gpt-oss-68911959590a1634ba11c7a4”). The project markets the family as “OpenAI’s open-weight models,” explicitly positioning it as an unrestricted download. Finally, command-line snippets such as parser.add_argument(\"model\", metavar=\"PATH\", … \"Path to gpt-oss model in Metal inference format\") and parser.add_argument('model', … 'Path to gpt-oss checkpoint') show that end-users can supply local paths once the checkpoints are retrieved, implying standard offline access after download. Together these quotes establish that anyone can fetch the weights, store them locally, and point inference scripts to those paths without additional gating or credential requirements.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "Multiple code-path references in the quotes confirm that at least a reference implementation of the full model stack is public. One line states: “We include an inefficient reference PyTorch implementation in [gpt_oss/torch/model.py].” Additional modules are surfaced: from gpt_oss.triton.model import TokenGenerator, from gpt_oss.torch.model import TokenGenerator, and from gpt_oss.vllm.token_generator import TokenGenerator. This indicates that the repository ships three back-ends (PyTorch, Triton, and vLLM) and that the maintainers expose a common TokenGenerator interface for each. Evaluation scripts are also open: - `python -m gpt_oss.evals --eval=healthbench --model=gpt-oss-120b` (and two variant invocations) demonstrate ready-to-run benchmarks that directly call the model. Another example, “# torchrun --nproc-per-node=4 -m gpt_oss.generate -p \"why did the chicken cross the road?\" model/,” shows a multi-GPU training/inference entry point using torchrun, suggesting that distributed data-parallel support is included. The parser excerpts (\"Chat with gpt-oss\") confirm that the repo contains CLI tooling for interactive chat. Collectively, the quotes reveal that the authors have open-sourced (1) a baseline PyTorch training/inference stack, (2) Triton and vLLM highly-optimized generators, (3) evaluation harnesses, and (4) helper CLIs—covering both core model code and ancillary utilities rather than inference-only stubs.",

  "1-4 (Paper)": "Although no formal academic PDF is quoted, two official references are given. First, an OpenAI blog post—\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/\"—likely serves as the primary announcement and high-level technical overview. Second, the appearance of “@misc{openai2025gptoss120bgptoss20b Model Card}” indicates that a detailed model card (hosted either on arXiv, Hugging Face, or a similar venue) exists under the usual BibTeX @misc entry, providing architecture, training data, evaluation metrics, and intended-use guidance.
