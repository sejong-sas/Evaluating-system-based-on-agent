  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes state that anyone can obtain the full parameter files for the model openly from the Hugging Face Hub. The explicit command given—“huggingface-cli download openai/gpt-oss-120b --include \"original/*\" --local-dir gpt-oss-120b/” —confirms that the gpt-oss-120b weights are hosted under the repository name “openai/gpt-oss-120b” and can be fetched with the standard Hugging Face CLI without any authentication token or special permission being mentioned. The download instruction also shows that all files inside the “original/” folder can be mirrored locally, implying the complete checkpoint is provided. A second line, “vllm serve openai/gpt-oss-120b,” demonstrates that once obtained the weights can be loaded directly in the vLLM inference server, further reinforcing public accessibility. No quote lists regional or user-tier restrictions, suggesting universal, free access.",

Although the quote does not explicitly separate pre-training, fine-tuning, or RL stages, it does confirm that at least inference (and possibly training) examples are available, written for PyTorch and supplemented by Triton kernels. No quote indicates that any portion of the training pipeline is withheld, but the wording “reference implementations” implies shared code for users to reproduce or adapt parts of the workflow.",
