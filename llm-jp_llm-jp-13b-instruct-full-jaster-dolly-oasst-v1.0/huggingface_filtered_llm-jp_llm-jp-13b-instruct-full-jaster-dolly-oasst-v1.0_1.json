  "1-1 (Weights)": "The available snippets consistently show that the weights for llm-jp/llm-jp-13b-instruct-full-jaster-dolly-oasst-v1.0 are published on-line through the Hugging Face Hub. Loading examples are given with the exact repository name in both the tokenizer line – “tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"llm-jp/llm-jp-13b-instruct-full-jaster-dolly-oasst-v1.0\")” – and the model line – “model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"llm-jp/llm-jp-13b-instruct-full-jaster-dolly-oasst-v1.0\", device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)”.  A checkpoint note adds that the default distribution format is “Hugging Face Transformers”, while an alternative “Megatron-DeepSpeed format” is also hosted at the sister URL “https://huggingface.co/llm-jp/llm-jp-13b-v1.0-mdsfmt”.  One of the weight shard files is explicitly listed as “pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin”, confirming multi-part binary checkpoints.  Together these quotes indicate that anyone with standard Hugging Face tooling can download and load the full model weights, either in standard Transformers sharded .bin files or in an optional Megatron-DeepSpeed layout.",
