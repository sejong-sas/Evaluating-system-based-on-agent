  "1-2 (Code)": "The only direct evidence about code is the line:\n  \"from llm_jp_eval.jaster.base import BaseDatasetProcessor, Sample, Split\"\nThis import statement demonstrates that a Python package bearing the exact target identifier (\"llm_jp_eval\") exists and exposes a module path \"jaster.base\" that defines at least three symbols—\"BaseDatasetProcessor\", \"Sample\", and \"Split\". From the naming, these appear to be utilities for dataset handling (processing, individual sample representation, and train/validation/test split management). Because the quote comes from executable source, it confirms that some portion of the project’s codebase is publicly readable and installable as a library. However, the excerpt is confined to data-set processing; it makes no explicit mention of full training or fine-tuning pipelines, hyper-parameter schedules, or reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback scripts. Consequently, we can only attest to the publication of evaluation or preprocessing utilities, not the end-to-end training code.",

This line reveals that a repository named \"llm-jp-eval-inference\" exists with a sub-module for the vLLM engine, and that users are expected to launch a long-running service via the command \"vllm serve\". The model checkpoint served is \"llm-jp/llm-jp-3-3.7b-instruct\", confirming that the model can be pulled by name from a registry and exposed through vLLM’s standard OpenAI-compatible HTTP API. The use of \"uv run\" indicates a managed Python environment for the server.

The process explicitly avoided using test data during tuning, yet yielded exceptionally high llm-jp-eval benchmark scores. Therefore, the fine-tuning workflow (a) leveraged jaster for instruction-following optimisation, (b) followed a data-splitting practice that prevented test-set contamination, and (c) measurably improved evaluation performance. No further details—such as learning-rate schedules, epoch counts, or dataset composition—are disclosed in the provided quotation.",
