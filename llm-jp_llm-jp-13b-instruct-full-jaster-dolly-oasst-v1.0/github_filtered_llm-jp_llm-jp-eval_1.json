  "1-2 (Code)": "The only direct evidence about code is the line:\n  \"from llm_jp_eval.jaster.base import BaseDatasetProcessor, Sample, Split\"\nThis import statement demonstrates that a Python package bearing the exact target identifier (\"llm_jp_eval\") exists and exposes a module path \"jaster.base\" that defines at least three symbols—\"BaseDatasetProcessor\", \"Sample\", and \"Split\". From the naming, these appear to be utilities for dataset handling (processing, individual sample representation, and train/validation/test split management). Because the quote comes from executable source, it confirms that some portion of the project’s codebase is publicly readable and installable as a library. However, the excerpt is confined to data-set processing; it makes no explicit mention of full training or fine-tuning pipelines, hyper-parameter schedules, or reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback scripts. Consequently, we can only attest to the publication of evaluation or preprocessing utilities, not the end-to-end training code.",
