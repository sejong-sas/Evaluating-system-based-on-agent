  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The available details explicitly state that “DeepSeek-R1-Zero & DeepSeek-R1 are trained based on DeepSeek-V3-Base.”  This indicates that the architectural blueprint of DeepSeek-R1 is not bespoke but rather an adoption (or at least a very close derivative) of the DeepSeek-V3-Base design.  The documentation further directs readers to external material—“For more details regarding the model architecture, please refer to [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) repository.”  Consequently, the core architectural parameters (layer counts, hidden sizes, attention heads, etc.) are expected to mirror those published for DeepSeek-V3-Base, and any fine-tuning or variant-specific adjustments for DeepSeek-R1 would be incremental extensions of that same layout.  Apart from this inheritance statement and the reference link, no additional architectural hyperparameters (e.g., depth, width, positional-encoding scheme, normalization strategy) are explicitly provided in the quotes.",
