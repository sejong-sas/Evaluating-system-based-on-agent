  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes explicitly state that the model family’s weights are openly released. One sentence notes: “To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.”  Two further sentences reinforce that status: “The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future,” and “The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.”  Taken together, these quotes confirm (1) public availability of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero weight files, (2) accompanying access through an API, and (3) release of six additional dense distilled checkpoints ranging in parameter count from 1.5 B to 70 B.  No access restrictions or gated-download language appears in the provided material; the repeated phrase “open-source” implies that anyone can obtain the checkpoints.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "No sentences in the supplied quotes mention the publication status of DeepSeek-R1 training code, data-processing scripts, configuration files, or any other part of the end-to-end training pipeline.  Therefore, no information about code availability can be extracted from the provided material.",
  "1-3 (License)": "The quote set contains no sentences that describe the license name, version, or any specific terms regarding use, modification, redistribution, or commercial rights.  Consequently, no licensing information is available from the given excerpts.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "Three separate quotes provide evidence of an official technical report or paper: “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,” along with contextual references: “We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1,” and “Figure 1 | Benchmark performance of DeepSeek-R1.”  Together, these lines show that (a) a formal document bearing that title exists, (b) it introduces both DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 as the first generation of the series, and (c) it contains at least one benchmark-summary figure (Figure 1) highlighting performance metrics.  No further bibliographic details (venue, date, authorship, URL) appear in the provided quotes.",
