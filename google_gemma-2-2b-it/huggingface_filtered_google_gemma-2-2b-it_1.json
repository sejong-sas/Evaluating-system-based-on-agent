  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes state that “Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google … with open weights for both pre-trained variants and instruction-tuned variants.”  For the target google/gemma-2-2b-it checkpoint this means that the weights themselves are openly released.  Distribution is occurring on Hugging Face, but “To access Gemma on Hugging Face, you’re required to review and agree to Google’s usage license,” so download is gated behind an electronic license click-through.  The model files are provided in `bfloat16` format (“The native weights of this model were exported in `bfloat16` precision.”) and at least one shard is explicitly listed (“model-00001-of-00002.safetensors”), implying a multi-file safetensors upload.  Functionally, the model is described as a “text-to-text, decoder-only large language model … available in English,” making clear that the released weights correspond to a decoder-only architecture suitable for text generation or completion tasks.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "Inference/serving code is available: “The local-gemma repository contains a lightweight wrapper around Transformers for running Gemma 2 through a command line interface, or CLI.” This public repository simplifies local execution of the 2-billion-parameter Gemma 2 models.  The training stack is mentioned—“Training was done using JAX and ML Pathways”—indicating that Google trained the model with internal JAX/Pathways infrastructure, but the quote does not indicate that this training code has been released.  Consequently, only inference/serving utilities (via the local-gemma wrapper) are openly published, while the end-to-end pre-training or fine-tuning scripts used internally remain undisclosed according to the provided material.",
