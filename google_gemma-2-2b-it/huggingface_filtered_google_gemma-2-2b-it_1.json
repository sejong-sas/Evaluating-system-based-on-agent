  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quotes state that \"Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.\" In the same sentence, the material clarifies that these models are \"text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights for both pre-trained variants and instruction-tuned variants.\" Therefore, the weights for every released Gemma variant are openly provided. A second quote adds a practical access detail, explaining that \"To access Gemma on Hugging Face, you’re required to review and agree to Google’s usage license.\" From these sentences we learn (a) openness of the weights, (b) availability of both the raw pre-trained checkpoints and the instruction-tuned checkpoints, and (c) the distribution channel (Hugging Face) plus the fact that users must first accept Google’s usage license before downloading.",

  "1-3 (License)": "Licensing is addressed in two separate sentences. First, \"To access Gemma on Hugging Face, you’re required to review and agree to Google’s usage license.\" Second, \"Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the [Gemma Prohibited Use Policy][prohibited-use].\" Taken together, these quotes make clear that use of the Gemma 2-2b weights is gated by a Google-specific usage license and an accompanying Prohibited Use Policy that enumerates forbidden applications. The exact quoted phrases highlight both the requirement to affirm the license and the existence of explicit restrictions under the Prohibited Use Policy.",
