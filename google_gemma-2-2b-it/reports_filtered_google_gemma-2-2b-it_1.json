{
  "1-1 (Weights)": "The project repeatedly emphasizes that the Gemma 2-series weights are openly released. The technical report states, “In this work, we introduce Gemma 2 … We release all our models to the community,” and a second passage echoes the same pledge: “Overall, Gemma 2 … We release all our models to the community.”  Availability spans the whole size range (“lightweight … 2 billion to 27 billion parameters”).  Practical distribution channels are named: “Previous Gemma models … are also available from Kaggle and Hugging Face,” and an example loading command is given—“model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\", …)”—showing that a user can pull the 2 B model directly from Hugging Face.  The weights are explicitly tagged as “open” and can be used commercially: “Gemma models are provided with open weights and permit responsible commercial use, allowing you to tune and deploy them in your own projects and applications.”  Training variants are covered as well: “We also train the 2B … models with knowledge distillation … We release all our models to the community,” confirming that even distilled checkpoints are distributed.  Altogether, the quotes confirm: (1) public, no-barrier download of every Gemma 2 model (including the 2 B checkpoint); (2) hosting on both Kaggle and Hugging Face; (3) an explicit green-light for commercial fine-tuning and deployment via the “open weights” wording.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "None of the supplied quotes mention releasing the model’s training pipeline, data-preparation scripts, configuration files, or any other form of training code. Only inference usage is illustrated (the Hugging Face AutoModel loading snippet). Therefore, based on the provided material, there is no public release information for Gemma 2 training code.",
  "1-3 (License)": "Licensing language appears in three separate excerpts.  First, the project notes a broad permission scope tied to the weights: “Gemma models are provided with open weights and permit responsible commercial use, allowing you to tune and deploy them in your own projects and applications.”  Second, it differentiates between site content and code samples: “Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.”  The first clause applies CC-BY-4.0 to documentation, while the second places any accompanying code snippets under Apache-2.0, a permissive license covering use, modification, redistribution, and commercial exploitation.  Finally, the footer line—“© 2024 Google DeepMind. All rights reserved”—indicates that, unless expressly covered by the earlier CC-BY-4.0 or Apache-2.0 statements, remaining materials are retained under full copyright.  No additional restrictions such as “non-commercial,” “no derivatives,” or “evaluation only” are mentioned in the quoted text.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "A formal technical report is repeatedly cited under the title “Gemma 2: Improving Open Language Models at a Practical Size.”  The authorship is attributed to “Gemma Team, Google DeepMind.”  One quote summarizes its scope: “In this technical report, we provide an overview of models, including the architecture, training, and pre- and post-training recipes for Gemma 2.”  The introductory sentence situates the work: “In this work, we introduce Gemma 2, a new addition to the Gemma family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models, ranging in scale from 2 billion to 27 billion parameters.”  The Gemma 2 family also serves as the language component of the multi-modal PaliGemma 2 system: “PaliGemma 2 is an upgrade of the PaliGemma open Vision-Language Model (VLM) based on the Gemma 2 family of language models,” and the paper mentions the use of “the whole range of Gemma 2 models, from the 2B one all the way up to the 27B model.”  Collectively, the quotes confirm that an official technical report exists, covers detailed methodology, and that derivative research (e.g., PaliGemma 2) builds directly on the publicly released Gemma 2 checkpoints.",
