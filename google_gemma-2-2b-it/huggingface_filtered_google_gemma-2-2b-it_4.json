  "4-1 (Pre-training Data)": "The only explicit information disclosed about the google/gemma-2-2b-it pre-training corpus concerns its overall scale. A single sentence states that the 2 B parameter variant was trained on 2 trillion tokens, while simultaneously noting that larger 9 B and 27 B versions consumed 8 trillion and 13 trillion tokens, respectively. No other details—such as concrete data sources, domain composition, licensing status, geographical or linguistic coverage, or the balance of modalities—are provided in the quoted material. Consequently, all that can be concluded is that the 2 B model’s pre-training set contained approximately 2 trillion text tokens, positioning it as the smallest member of the family in terms of both parameter count and raw training-data volume.",

  "4-4 (Data Filtering)": "One qualifying sentence reveals that automated sensitive-data filtering was applied: “As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain personal information and other sensitive data from training sets.” From this, it can be inferred that the developers implemented programmatic sanitation procedures specifically aimed at excising personal or otherwise sensitive content from the pre-training corpus before or during training. No further operational details (e.g., rule-based vs. model-based detection, false-positive/negative rates, or downstream impacts on model utility) are provided.",
