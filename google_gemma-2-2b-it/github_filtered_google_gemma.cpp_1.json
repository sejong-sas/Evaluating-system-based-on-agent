  "1-1 (Weights)": "The project explicitly states that the \"Model weights, including gemma.cpp specific artifacts, are [available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma-2).\"  Users are instructed to \"Visit the [Kaggle page for Gemma-2](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma-2/gemmaCpp) and select `Model Variations |> Gemma C++`.\"  This means anyone with a Kaggle account can navigate to the cited page and pick the Gemma-specific C++ variant of the files.  The notes further clarify the scope of those artifacts: \"gemma.cpp is an **open source** C++ inference engine for running Google’s Gemma 2B and 7B models **without requiring the original TensorFlow or JAX checkpoints.**\"  In practice, this indicates that the repository hosts weight files already converted into the custom binary format expected by gemma.cpp, so a user does not need to download or handle the proprietary TensorFlow/JAX checkpoints that Google originally released.  No password, EULA acceptance, or gated request process is mentioned in the provided quotes, implying the weights can be fetched directly from the public Kaggle listing.  Together these lines confirm the weights’ public availability, their Kaggle location, and their readiness for immediate use by gemma.cpp.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "Several snippets describe the public code base.  The core claim is that \"gemma.cpp provides a minimalist implementation of Gemma-2, Gemma-3, and PaliGemma-2 models, focusing on simplicity and directness rather than full generality.\"  The repository therefore exposes an end-to-end C++ inference engine, not merely utilities.  Concrete usage examples are embedded in the codebase, for instance: \"\"\"A simple example of using the gemma.cpp Python wrapper.\"\"\" and a separate conversion utility: \"\"\"Convert a PaliGemma[1/2] model from SafeTensors to gemma.cpp format.\"\"\"  These quotes demonstrate that (1) the inference engine itself is open-source C++, (2) there is a Python wrapper for easier scripting, and (3) ancillary tooling is provided to transform SafeTensors checkpoints into the lighter gemma.cpp binary layout.  None of the excerpts reference full pre-training or fine-tuning scripts, optimizer schedules, or large-scale data-prep jobs; all examples revolve around inference and format conversion, underscoring that the public code is aimed at deployment rather than training.  Nonetheless, because every file cited is in the same repository and no access restrictions are mentioned, the training-adjacent utilities (e.g., the conversion script) can also be examined, modified, or extended by any user.",
