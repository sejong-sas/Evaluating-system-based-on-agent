  "1-5 (Architecture)": "For microsoft/phi-4 the quoted metadata declares a \"14B parameters, dense decoder-only Transformer model\", establishing both parameter count and overall design. Additional configuration fields specify \"num_hidden_layers\": 40, \"hidden_size\": 5120, and \"num_attention_heads\": 40. Collectively these lines describe a dense, decoder-only Transformer containing 40 stacked layers; every layer operates over a model width of 5 120 hidden units and uses 40 parallel attention heads, yielding a 14-billion-parameter architecture.",
