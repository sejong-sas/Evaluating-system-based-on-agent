  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The quoted material presents a concise yet data-rich snapshot of the model’s internals. It identifies the system as a “dense decoder-only Transformer model” with a total scale of “14B parameters.” Configuration lines then spell out the principal hyper-parameters: a hidden (embedding) size of 5 120 (\"hidden_size\": 5120), forty transformer blocks (\"num_hidden_layers\": 40), and forty attention heads per block (\"num_attention_heads\": 40). The feed-forward sub-layers expand to 17 920 neurons (\"intermediate_size\": 17920), while positional encoding is provisioned up to 16 384 tokens (\"max_position_embeddings\": 16384). Taken together, these figures detail depth, width, attention parallelism, and maximum context window purely from the supplied quotes.",
