  "2-3 (API)": "The only explicit information about an end-user interface appears in a short code fragment that demonstrates how to invoke text generation for the microsoft/phi-4 model through the Hugging Face Transformers library. The example constructs a transformers.pipeline with the task string set to \"text-generation\" and the model argument set to the exact identifier \"microsoft/phi-4\"; it also passes model_kwargs={\"torch_dtype\": \"auto\"} so that the framework will automatically pick an appropriate PyTorch data type, and it sets device_map=\"auto\" so that hardware placement is handled for the user. From this snippet we can conclude that phi-4 is already published on (or is compatible with) the Hugging Face Hub, that it can be loaded with default text-generation heads, and that standard convenience features—automatic dtype selection and automatic multi-GPU or CPU/GPU placement—work out of the box. No additional public documentation, endpoint URL, authentication scheme, or rate-limit policy is given in the quotes, so the only concrete, quoted evidence of an API is this transformers pipeline usage example.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The pre-training description of phi-4 portrays it as “a state-of-the-art open model” that was trained on a deliberately curated mixture of data sources. According to the quote, those sources include (1) synthetic datasets, (2) data extracted from filtered public-domain websites, and (3) acquired academic books and Q&A corpora. The stated objective of blending these ingredients was to ensure that even a relatively small model could learn from material that is simultaneously high in quality and rich in advanced-reasoning signals. No token counts, model-size details, or curriculum schedule are provided in the supplied quotation, but the passage underlines that the designers emphasized data quality over raw volume and targeted reasoning-oriented examples during the initial pre-training stage.",

    }
  ],
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "For post-pre-training enhancement, the quotation indicates that phi-4 “underwent a rigorous enhancement and alignment process” that explicitly combined supervised fine-tuning with direct preference optimization (DPO). The supervised component implies that the model was further trained on instruction–response pairs in order to tighten its adherence to desired prompts, while the DPO step directly optimizes the model toward human-preferred outputs without the need for separate reward models. The stated goals of this fine-tuning phase were twofold: (1) to achieve precise instruction compliance and (2) to instill robust safety safeguards. No dataset names, epoch counts, or hyperparameter specifics are given in the available text, but the quote makes clear that fine-tuning was a deliberate, multi-stage pipeline aimed at both capability and alignment.",

    }
  ],
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "The reinforcement-learning-related information is embedded in the same sentence that describes the broader alignment process: phi-4 incorporated direct preference optimization in addition to supervised fine-tuning. DPO is a form of policy-gradient-style optimization that sidesteps separately trained reward models and directly adjusts the model’s parameters to prefer preferred outputs over less-preferred ones, thereby acting as a lightweight alternative to traditional RLHF or PPO. The explicit mention of DPO reveals that the developers used at least one reinforcement-learning-based method to tune phi-4 toward human preferences. While the quote does not enumerate hyperparameters such as learning rate, KL penalties, or step counts, it does highlight the purpose of the RL step: reinforcing precise instruction adherence and safety. No other RL variants (e.g., PPO, RLHF with reward models) are referenced in the supplied material.",
