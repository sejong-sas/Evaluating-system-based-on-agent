While in some cases the public\n> can interact with these models through paid APIs, full model access is currently limited to only a\n> few highly resourced labs. This restricted access has limited researchers’ ability to study how and\n> why these large language models work, hindering progress on improving known challenges in areas\n> such as robustness, bias, and toxicity.\n\n> We present Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M\n> to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We train the OPT models to roughly match \n> the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data\n> collection and efficient training. Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and\n> to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs. Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the\n> collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study.\n\n## Model description\n\nOPT was predominantly pretrained with English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the training corpus via CommonCrawl. The model was pretrained using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective.\nOPT belongs to the same family of decoder-only models like [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). As such, it was pretrained using the self-supervised causal language modedling objective.\n\nFor evaluation, OPT follows [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup. For more details, please read \nthe [official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068).\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe pretrained-only model can be used for prompting for evaluation of downstream tasks as well as text generation.\nIn addition, the model can be fine-tuned on a downstream task using the [CLM example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling). For all other OPT checkpoints, please have a look at the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=opt).\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation.\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model=\"facebook/opt-125m\")\n>>> generator(\"What are we having for dinner?\")\n[{'generated_text': 'What are we having for dinner?\\nA nice dinner with a friend.\\nI'm not sure'}]\n```\n\nBy default, generation is deterministic. In order to use the top-k sampling, please set `do_sample` to `True`. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n\n>>> set_seed(32)\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model=\"facebook/opt-125m\", do_sample=True)\n>>> generator(\"What are we having for dinner?\")\n[{'generated_text': 'What are we having for dinner?\\nCoffee, sausage and cream cheese at Chili's.'}]\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nAs mentioned in Meta AI's model card, given that the training data used for this model contains a lot of\nunfiltered content from the internet, which is far from neutral the model is strongly biased : \n\n> Like other large language models for which the diversity (or lack thereof) of training\n> data induces downstream impact on the quality of our model, OPT-175B has limitations in terms\n> of bias and safety. OPT-175B can also have quality issues in terms of generation diversity and\n> hallucination. In general, OPT-175B is not immune from the plethora of issues that plague modern\n> large language models. \n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe Meta AI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. It is composed of the union of the following 5 filtered datasets of textual documents: \n\n  - BookCorpus, which consists of more than 10K unpublished books,\n  - CC-Stories, which contains a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the\nstory-like style of Winograd schemas,\n  - The Pile, from which * Pile-CC, OpenWebText2, USPTO, Project Gutenberg, OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, DM Mathematics and HackerNews* were included. \n  - Pushshift.io Reddit dataset that was developed in Baumgartner et al. (2020) and processed in\nRoller et al. (2021)\n  - CCNewsV2 containing an updated version of the English portion of the CommonCrawl News\ndataset that was used in RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b)\n\nThe final training data contains 180B tokens corresponding to 800GB of data. The validation split was made of 200MB of the pretraining data, sampled proportionally\nto each dataset’s size in the pretraining corpus. \n\nThe dataset might contains offensive content as parts of the dataset are a subset of\npublic Common Crawl data, along with a subset of public Reddit data, which could contain sentences\nthat, if viewed directly, can be insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety.\n\n### Collection process\n\nThe dataset was collected form internet, and went through classic data processing algorithms  and\nre-formatting practices, including removing repetitive/non-informative text like *Chapter One* or\n*This ebook by Project Gutenberg.*\n\n## Training procedure\n\n\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using the **GPT2** byte-level version of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) (for unicode characters) and a\nvocabulary size of 50272. The inputs are sequences of 2048 consecutive tokens.\n\nThe 175B model was trained on 992 *80GB A100 GPUs*. The training duration was roughly ~33 days of continuous training.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{zhang2022opt,\n      title={OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models}, \n      author={Susan Zhang and Stephen Roller and Naman Goyal and Mikel Artetxe and Moya Chen and Shuohui Chen and Christopher Dewan and Mona Diab and Xian Li and Xi Victoria Lin and Todor Mihaylov and Myle Ott and Sam Shleifer and Kurt Shuster and Daniel Simig and Punit Singh Koura and Anjali Sridhar and Tianlu Wang and Luke Zettlemoyer},\n      year={2022},\n      eprint={2205.01068},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n```",
