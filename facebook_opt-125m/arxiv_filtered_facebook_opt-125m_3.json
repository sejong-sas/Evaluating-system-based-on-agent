  "2-3 (API)": "None of the provided sentences that explicitly reference the facebook/opt-125m model (or that contain the required tokens such as “OPT” or “125M”) mention an externally hosted or publicly exposed API, any API endpoints, SDK instructions, rate limits, authentication flow, example code snippets, or official documentation describing how to call the model through an online service. Consequently, the quotes give no evidence that an interactive, GPT-style or Gemini-style API exists for facebook/opt-125m at the time of the cited material.",
  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The quotes describe the pre-training strategy for the OPT family, explicitly covering the 125 M-parameter variant: 1) Model family and goal: “Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT)” is introduced as a suite of decoder-only transformers ranging from 125 M to 175 B parameters, intended to be “fully and responsibly” shared and to “roughly match the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models.” 2) Hardware and parallelism: Large models (e.g., OPT-175B) are trained on 992 × 80 GB A100 GPUs using Fully Sharded Data Parallel along with Megatron-LM tensor parallelism; the same training infrastructure underpins the smaller baselines such as 125 M. 3) Optimizer and schedule: All sizes from 125 M through 175 B use AdamW. A linear learning-rate schedule is applied: warm-up from 0 to the peak LR over the first 2 000 steps for the largest model, or equivalently over 375 M tokens for smaller baselines, followed by a decay to 10 % of the peak over 300 B tokens. 4) Data composition: A five-way union of corpora (three RoBERTa sets, a subset of The Pile, plus Pushshift Reddit) is used; the same pool “was used to pre-train the OPT models,” explicitly including the 125 M instance. 5) Architecture and hyper-parameters for facebook/opt-125m: Table 1 lists 12 transformer layers, 12 attention heads, a model/embedding dimension of 768, a peak learning rate of 6.0 × 10⁻⁴, and a global batch size of 0.5 M tokens. 6) Personnel and reproducibility: The 125 M–66 B baselines were trained by Naman Goyal, Stephen Roller, and Susan Zhang, and detailed process notes are promised in Sections 2.2–2.5 plus the data card appendix. Together, these points describe the end-to-end pre-training recipe—data pipeline, compute setup, optimizer choice, LR schedule, and explicit architecture numbers—for facebook/opt-125m.",
  "3-2 (Fine-tuning)": "Direct fine-tuning information for facebook/opt-125m is not given, but the quotes that do reference the OPT family (and thus satisfy the token requirement) still provide relevant insights into the broader fine-tuning strategy envisioned by the authors. They state that OPT-175B, when used in a fully unsupervised manner, already performs competitively with the supervised BlenderBot 1 model on ConvAI2, indicating a baseline capability. They then observe, by comparison to Xu et al. (2020), that models fine-tuned on curated dialogue datasets (specifically BlenderBot 1 and R2C2) produce lower toxicity, which leads to the recommendation that “future experimentation of OPT-175B for dialogue should contain explicit fine-tuning on curated datasets in order to improve the safety profile.” Extrapolating within the same methodological framework, this implies that the 125 M variant would likely benefit from similar dataset-targeted fine-tuning for safety and quality, even though explicit hyper-parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rates) are not provided in the quotes.",
  "3-3 (Reinforcement Learning)": "No sentences containing the required tokens (‘OPT’, ‘125M’, etc.) describe any reinforcement-learning-based training extensions such as RLHF, RLAIF, DPO, PPO, or any other reward-model or policy-optimization stage for facebook/opt-125m. Consequently, the cited material provides no evidence that reinforcement learning has been applied to the model.",
