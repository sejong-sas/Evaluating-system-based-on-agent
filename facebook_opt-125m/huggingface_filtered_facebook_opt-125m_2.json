  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The information that explicitly references the facebook/opt-125m variant comes from two configuration-style excerpts. First, the project description states that “Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT)” is “a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters,” which places the 125 million-parameter checkpoint at the smallest end of the publicly described family and confirms that it follows a decoder-only design. A separate configuration block, again tagged with \"model_type\": \"opt\", specifies the concrete architectural hyper-parameters that apply to the 125 M model size: hidden_size of 768, 12 transformer layers (num_hidden_layers = 12), 12 attention heads (num_attention_heads = 12), a feed-forward network dimension of 3 072, and support for sequences up to 2 048 tokens via max_position_embeddings. Together these two quotes indicate that facebook/opt-125m is the 125 M-parameter member of the OPT series and that its core architecture is a 12-layer, 768-hidden-dimension, decoder-only transformer with 12-head self-attention and 3 072-dimensional feed-forward sub-layers, able to handle contexts of up to 2 048 tokens.",

  "1-6 (Tokenizer)": "A tokenizer configuration snippet labeled with \"model_type\": \"opt\" supplies all available details. For facebook/opt-125m the beginning-of-sequence (bos_token_id) and end-of-sequence (eos_token_id) are both mapped to integer 2, while the padding token (pad_token_id) is 1. The vocabulary contains 50 272 entries (vocab_size = 50272). No information about tokenizer architecture beyond these IDs and vocabulary size is given, but the quote confirms that these values are formally tied to an OPT model configuration and therefore apply to the 125 M checkpoint.",
