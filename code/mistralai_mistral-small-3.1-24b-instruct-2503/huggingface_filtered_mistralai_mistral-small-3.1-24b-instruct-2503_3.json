  "2-3 (API)": "The provided evidence quote states: 'We recommand that you use Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503 in a server/client setting.' This indicates that the model is recommended for deployment in a server/client environment, which implies the model is accessible through an API that supports such a setup. The recommendation suggests that the API is designed to facilitate interaction with the model in a client-server configuration.",
