To prevent any disruptions due to model updates and breaking changes, it is recommended to use the dated versions of the Mistral AI API. Additionally, be prepared for the deprecation of certain endpoints in the coming months. Here are the details of the available versions: magistral-medium-latest : currently points to magistral-medium-2507 . magistral-small-latest : currently points to magistral-small-2507 . mistral-medium-latest : currently points to mistral-medium-2508 . mistral-large-latest : currently points to mistral-medium-2508 , previously mistral-large-2411 . pixtral-large-latest : currently points to pixtral-large-2411 . mistral-moderation-latest : currently points to mistral-moderation-2411 . ministral-3b-latest : currently points to ministral-3b-2410 . ministral-8b-latest : currently points to ministral-8b-2410 . open-mistral-nemo : currently points to open-mistral-nemo-2407 . mistral-small-latest : currently points to mistral-small-2506 . devstral-small-latest : currently points to devstral-small-2507 devstral-medium-latest : currently points to devstral-medium-2507 mistral-saba-latest : currently points to mistral-saba-2502 . codestral-latest : currently points to codestral-2508 . mistral-ocr-latest : currently points to mistral-ocr-2505 . voxtral-small-latest : currently points to voxtral-small-2507 . voxtral-mini-latest : currently points to voxtral-mini-2507 . Model deprecation ​ Overview ​ Our model offering is continuously refreshed with newer, better models. As part of this process, we deprecate and retire older models. This document provides information about which models are currently available, deprecated, or retired. Terminology ​ Deprecation date: The date to mark the model as deprecated. When a model is deprecated, it continues to be available for use by customers with existing deployments until the model is retired. Retirement date: The date to mark the model as retired. When a model is retired from la Plateforme, it is no longer available for use, and when prompted, it will return an error response. How to Prepare for Model Retirements and Version Upgrades ​ To prepare for model retirements and version upgrades, we recommend that customers evaluate their applications with the new models and versions and assess their behavior. We also recommend that customers update their applications to use the new models and versions before the retirement date Legacy models ​ Model Weight availability API Endpoints Version Deprecation date Retirement date Alternative model Mistral 7B ✔️ Apache2 open-mistral-7b v0.3 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 ministral-8b-latest Mixtral 8x7B ✔️ Apache2 open-mixtral-8x7b v0.1 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 mistral-small-latest Mixtral 8x22B ✔️ Apache2 open-mixtral-8x22b v0.1 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 mistral-small-latest Mistral Medium 2312 mistral-medium-2312 23.12 2024/11/30 2025/06/16 mistral-medium-latest Mistral Small 2402 mistral-small-2402 24.02 2024/11/30 2025/06/16 mistral-small-latest Mistral Large 2402 mistral-large-2402 24.02 2024/11/30 2025/06/16 mistral-medium-latest Mistral Large 2407 ✔️ Mistral Research License mistral-large-2407 24.02 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 mistral-medium-latest Codestral 2405 ✔️ Mistral Non-Production License codestral-2405 24.05 2024/12/02 2025/06/16 codestral-latest Mistral OCR 2503 mistral-ocr-2503 25.03 2025/06/10 2026/03/31 mistral-ocr-latest Mistral Saba 2502 mistral-saba-2502 25.02 2025/06/10 2025/09/30 mistral-small-latest Mathstral 7B ✔️ Apache2 v0.1 magistral-small-latest Codestral Mamba ✔️ Apache2 open-codestral-mamba v0.1 2525/06/06 2525/06/06 codestral-latest Previous Quickstart Next Models Benchmarks Premier models Open models API versioning Model deprecation Overview Terminology How to Prepare for Model Retirements and Version Upgrades Legacy models Documentation Documentation Contributing Community Discord X GitHub Copyright © 2025 Mistral AI.
