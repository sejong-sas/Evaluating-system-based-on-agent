  "1-1 (Weights)": "The evidence clearly indicates that the model weights are provided in the .safetensors format with specific file names, as seen by the inclusion of 'consolidated.safetensors' and 'model-00001-of-00010.safetensors'. These quotes demonstrate that the model weights are available as downloadable files, with naming conventions suggesting both a consolidated weight file and a segmented format for large models.",
