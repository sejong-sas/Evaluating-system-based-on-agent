In the first quote, the tokenizer is instantiated with the command 'tokenizer = MistralTokenizer.from_file(\"./mistral-nemo-instruct-v0.1/tekken.json\")  # change to extracted tokenizer file', explicitly referencing 'MistralTokenizer' and a file path for loading the tokenizer configuration. The second quote, 'mistral_tokenizer: MistralTokenizer = load_tokenizer(Path(model_path))', further confirms the specific usage of the Mistral tokenizer by instantiating a variable with the identifier 'mistral_tokenizer' and using a loading function that accepts a model path. Both quotes make it clear that the tokenizer used is intended for Mistral, ensuring that only relevant details connected to the mistral model are included.",
