Model deprecation ​ Overview ​ Our model offering is continuously refreshed with newer, better models. As part of this process, we deprecate and retire older models. This document provides information about which models are currently available, deprecated, or retired. Terminology ​ Deprecation date: The date to mark the model as deprecated. When a model is deprecated, it continues to be available for use by customers with existing deployments until the model is retired. Retirement date: The date to mark the model as retired. When a model is retired from la Plateforme, it is no longer available for use, and when prompted, it will return an error response. How to Prepare for Model Retirements and Version Upgrades ​ To prepare for model retirements and version upgrades, we recommend that customers evaluate their applications with the new models and versions and assess their behavior. We also recommend that customers update their applications to use the new models and versions before the retirement date Legacy models ​ Model Weight availability API Endpoints Version Deprecation date Retirement date Alternative model Mistral 7B ✔️ Apache2 open-mistral-7b v0.3 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 ministral-8b-latest Mixtral 8x7B ✔️ Apache2 open-mixtral-8x7b v0.1 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 mistral-small-latest Mixtral 8x22B ✔️ Apache2 open-mixtral-8x22b v0.1 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 mistral-small-latest Mistral Medium 2312 mistral-medium-2312 23.12 2024/11/30 2025/06/16 mistral-medium-latest Mistral Small 2402 mistral-small-2402 24.02 2024/11/30 2025/06/16 mistral-small-latest Mistral Large 2402 mistral-large-2402 24.02 2024/11/30 2025/06/16 mistral-medium-latest Mistral Large 2407 ✔️ Mistral Research License mistral-large-2407 24.02 2024/11/30 2025/03/30 mistral-medium-latest Codestral 2405 ✔️ Mistral Non-Production License codestral-2405 24.05 2024/12/02 2025/06/16 codestral-latest Mistral OCR 2503 mistral-ocr-2503 25.03 2025/06/10 2026/03/31 mistral-ocr-latest Mistral Saba 2502 mistral-saba-2502 25.02 2025/06/10 2025/09/30 mistral-small-latest Mathstral 7B ✔️ Apache2 v0.1 magistral-small-latest Codestral Mamba ✔️ Apache2 open-codestral-mamba v0.1 2525/06/06 2525/06/06 codestral-latest Previous Quickstart Next Models Benchmarks Premier models Open models API versioning Model deprecation Overview Terminology How to Prepare for Model Retirements and Version Upgrades Legacy models Documentation Documentation Contributing Community Discord X GitHub Copyright © 2025 Mistral AI.

Hu , Yelong Shen , Phillip Wallis , Zeyuan Allen-Zhu , Yuanzhi Li , Shean Wang , Lu Wang , Weizhu Chen View a PDF of the paper titled LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models, by Edward J. Hu and 7 other authors View PDF Abstract: An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at this https URL .
