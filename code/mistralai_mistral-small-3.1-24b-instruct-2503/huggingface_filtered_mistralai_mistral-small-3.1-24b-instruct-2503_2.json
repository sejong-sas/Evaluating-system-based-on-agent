  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The model builds upon the foundation of Mistral Small 3 (2501) and introduces significant enhancements, as noted in the evidence: 'Building upon Mistral Small 3 (2501), Mistral Small 3.1 (2503) adds state-of-the-art vision understanding and enhances long context capabilities up to 128k tokens without compromising text performance.' This is further supported by its impressive scale, being equipped with '24 billion parameters,' which enables it to achieve 'top-tier capabilities in both text and vision tasks.'",
