  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The provided quotes detail the architecture of the DeepSeek-R1 model. One quote explicitly displays the model details as 'DeepSeek-R1 | 671B | 37B | 128K', suggesting key numerical attributes associated with the model such as a high parameter count and a large context window, hinting at its extensive capacity and scale. The architecture is further specified by the mention of 'DeepseekV3ForCausalLM', indicating that the model employs a variant tailored for causal language modeling. This architectural nuance may be indicative of advanced transformer-based designs and further aligns with its deployment on platforms like HuggingFace.",
