  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The provided quote describes the architectural configuration of the DeepSeek-R1 family, emphasizing that both DeepSeek-R1 and its variant DeepSeek-R1-Zero have been open-sourced. Additionally, the quote highlights the release of six dense models with varying sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B parameters) that were derived from DeepSeek-R1. These models were distilled from the original DeepSeek-R1 architecture, leveraging the design principles and insights of established models like Qwen and Llama, thereby indicating a blend of innovative design with proven techniques.",
