  "1-1 (Weights)": "The quote details the public availability of model weights for various versions of DeepSeek-R1. Notably, the release includes DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 alongside six additional dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1, with parameter sizes ranging from 1.5B to 70B. These models have been derived using methodologies based on both Qwen and Llama, and their open-source release emphasizes support for the research community by facilitating access, experimentation, and further development.",
