Second, ‚ÄúSee the llama-cookbook repo for an example of how to add a safety checker to the inputs and outputs of your inference code.‚Äù adds that practical implementation guidance can be found in the publicly available ‚Äòllama-cookbook‚Äô repository, which includes code-level illustrations of wrapping inference calls with a safety checker. Together, these quotes specify the core criterion‚Äîusing classifier-based gating for safety‚Äîand point to a concrete pipeline resource (llama-cookbook) that operationalizes the approach. No numeric thresholds, false-positive metrics, or corpus-level removal percentages are disclosed, but the text makes clear that filtering is applied symmetrically to incoming and outgoing data and is modular enough to be swapped or extended with additional classifiers.",
