  "1-5 (Architecture)": "The available quotes give several explicit architectural details for the meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct family. First, the model is described as “Llama 3.3 … an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture,” establishing that it follows the standard decoder-only, next-token-prediction paradigm. Parameter scale is fixed at “70B,” and the tabulated information (“| Llama 3.3 (text only) … | 70B |”) confirms this figure while also implying that the specific checkpoint summarized here is the text-only variant of the 70-billion-parameter series. The same table line reports a maximum context window of “128k,” indicating the model was engineered for extremely long-context inference. Training‐data scale is given as “15T+” tokens, and a note clarifies, “Token counts refer to pretraining data only,” so downstream fine-tuning tokens are in addition to that total. Coverage is “Multilingual Text and code,” signaling that both natural-language and coding corpora were included in the curriculum. Finally, “All model versions use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability,” identifying GQA as a core architectural optimization applied across the Llama 3.3 range. In sum, the llama-3.3-70B-instruct checkpoint is a 70-billion-parameter, auto-regressive transformer with GQA, a 128 000-token context length, and was pretrained on more than fifteen trillion multilingual text-and-code tokens collected up to December 2023.",

  "2-1 (Hardware)": "For meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, the quoted sources state that training \"utilized a cumulative of 39.3 M GPU hours of computation on H100-80 GB (TDP of 700 W) type hardware.\" The accompanying hardware table row, “| Llama 3.3 70B | 7.0M | 700 | 2,040 | 0 |,” lists figures alongside the model name; although column headers are not supplied in the excerpt, the numbers are tied directly to the 70-B-parameter run. Together, the quotes establish that the project relied on NVIDIA H100-80 GB accelerators—each rated at 700 W—and that the aggregate compute expenditure amounted to 39.3 million GPU-hours, with the table further hinting at metrics such as 7.0 million (possibly node-hours or training steps) and a fleet size on the order of 2 040 devices or nodes.",
