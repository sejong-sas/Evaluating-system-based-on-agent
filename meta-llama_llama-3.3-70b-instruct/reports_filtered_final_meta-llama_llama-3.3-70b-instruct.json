{
  "1-1 (Weights)": "All quoted passages agree that the model weights for meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct are downloadable. The documentation repeatedly introduces the model under the exact name “Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct” and explicitly tells developers to install it in place of the older instruction-tuned Llama 3.1 70B. Several imperative sentences – “Download the new Llama 3.3 model.”, “Download the models”, and “install and use the new model” – all point to the same official download page hosted at llama.com. One sentence adds that the weights may also be obtained “directly from Meta or from one of our partners” and lists distribution channels: Hugging Face, Kaggle, and designated 1B/3B or 405B ecosystem-partner portals. A note highlights that Llama 3.3 70B is an instruction-tuned release that incorporates “the latest advancements in post-training techniques” and directs readers to its GitHub model card for performance details. In short, the supplied text confirms the public availability of the weights, enumerates multiple mirror sites, and positions Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct as the canonical replacement for the earlier 3.1 70B checkpoint.",
  "1-2 (Code)": "The quotes mention two public code resources. The first, repeatedly called the “Llama Cookbook”, contains “Notebooks and demos for learning Llama” together with “Scripts for fine-tuning Llama3 with single/multi-node GPUs”, indicating that hands-on tutorials and operational fine-tuning scripts are available. The second resource, \"Llama Stack\", is described as defining and standardizing “the building blocks needed to bring generative AI applications to market”. No excerpt claims that the full pre-training pipeline is open-sourced; the only explicitly released parts are educational notebooks and fine-tuning scripts. There is also no mention of RLHF or inference-only code. Therefore the public code coverage, according to the quotes, is limited to fine-tuning and application scaffolding rather than end-to-end pre-training.",
  "1-3 (License)": "No licensing text is present in the supplied quotations; they contain no references to license names, usage rights, redistribution restrictions, or commercial clauses.",
  "1-4 (Paper)": "The only technical reference surfaced by the quotations is the model card: two notes direct readers to “see the [model card] … for detailed performance information” hosted at GitHub under models/llama3_3/MODEL_CARD.md. Another bullet links to a card for llama4. No academic paper or formal technical report is cited. Instead, several corporate blog posts are listed – collaborations with Oracle for Instituto PROA, Biofy Technologies’ fight against antibiotic resistance, and a joint AWS program for startups. Collectively these passages show that official documentation currently revolves around model cards and outreach blog articles rather than a peer-reviewed paper.",
