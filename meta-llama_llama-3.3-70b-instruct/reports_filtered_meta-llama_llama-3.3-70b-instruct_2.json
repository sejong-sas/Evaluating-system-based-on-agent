  "2-1 (Hardware)": "The reference line says: “Scripts for fine-tuning Llama3 with single/multi-node GPUs.”  From this we learn that the prescribed training setup for Llama3 is capable of running on both single-GPU machines and distributed multi-node GPU clusters, highlighting GPU-based hardware scalability for fine-tuning tasks.",
