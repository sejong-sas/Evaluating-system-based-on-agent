  "1-1 (Weights)": "The single sentence provided—“This repository provides a 3.6B parameters Japanese language model, trained by [LINE Corporation](https://linecorp.com/ja/)”—states that the weights for the target model are hosted directly in the same repository that carries its README. The wording “provides” indicates that the full set of model parameters (3.6 billion in total) is made available there rather than merely being described or referred to, implying that a user visiting the repository can obtain them without further gate-keeping. No other sentences expand on mirrors, checkpoints, or special access conditions, so all that can be asserted from the quotes is that the repository itself is the place where the weights live and that they are exposed to the public in association with LINE Corporation’s release of a Japanese-language model of that exact scale (3.6 B).",

  "1-2 (Code)": "None of the supplied quotes contain any sentence mentioning the release status of training code, fine-tuning scripts, inference utilities, or pipeline specifics for the 3.6 B Japanese model. Because no quote addresses code at all, there is no basis to claim that any portion—pre-training, fine-tuning, RL, or otherwise—is public or private. The available evidence is therefore silent on the availability of training or serving code.",

The Apache-2.0 license is a permissive open-source license that, by its own terms, grants broad rights to use, modify, distribute and sublicense, including for commercial purposes, provided that copyright notices and the license text itself are preserved. No quote introduces additional restrictions or carve-outs beyond those standard Apache-2.0 terms, so the model inherits the full set of customary freedoms (commercial redistribution, derivative works, patent grant, etc.) and obligations (notice retention, no trademark use without permission) set forth in that license.",

[Tech Blog](https://engineering.linecorp.com/ja/blog/3.6-billion-parameter-japanese-language-model) explains details.”  From this we can summarize that there is no academic paper cited, but there is an official engineering or technology blog post published by LINE Corporation that serves as the primary technical reference or report for the model. The blog link is explicitly provided and is presented as the vehicle that “explains details,” indicating that readers should consult that article for methodology, architecture choices, training data description, evaluation results, or any other technical exposition associated with the 3.6 B Japanese language model.",
