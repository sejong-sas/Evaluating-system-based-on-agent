  "2-3 (API)": "Two separate snippets demonstrate that the NVIDIA Megatron-LM codebase deliberately exposes a public, code-level interface that users can call. The first sentence states that \"Megatron Core expands upon Megatron-LM's GPU-optimized techniques with more cutting-edge innovations on system-level optimizations, featuring composable and modular APIs.\"  The explicit promise of \"composable and modular APIs\" confirms that the project is packaged so external callers can interact with it in a structured, officially supported way.  The second excerpt shows a concrete usage example: \"from megatron.core.inference.inference_client import InferenceClient\".  This import line reveals the existence of an InferenceClient object located under the namespace megatron.core.inference, indicating that a ready-made client class is supplied for performing inference through a function-call–style API.  Although no web endpoint or SaaS gateway is mentioned in the supplied text, these two lines together prove that Megatron-LM provides an accessible programmatic interface for inference, designed to be incorporated directly into user code and benefiting from the underlying GPU-optimized and system-level innovations of Megatron Core.",

  "3-1 (Pre-training)": "The quoted material outlines a full reference pipeline for training Megatron-LM models.  A comment labels the repository as a \"**Reference implementation** that includes Megatron Core plus everything needed to train models,\" establishing that all required components are packaged together.  Users kick off the workflow by importing the dedicated entry point: \"from megatron.training import pretrain\".  Prior to launching training, the environment is prepared with a call to \"initialize_megatron(\", signaling a centralized initializer that sets up distributed infrastructure and any global configuration.  Additional helper routines—\"get_args\", \"get_model\", and \"get_tokenizer\"—are pulled from the same package via \"from megatron.training import get_args, get_model, get_tokenizer\", clarifying that argument parsing, model construction, and tokenizer configuration are all handled within the framework.  Checkpoint handling is addressed explicitly: \"Load *ckpt_dir* into *module* using Megatron distributed-checkpointing,\" pointing to a built-in loader capable of reading sharded checkpoints across multiple GPUs or nodes.  A follow-up comment notes that users should \"# Use Megatron utility if available – covers both distributed and non-distributed cases,\" highlighting that the same utility functions transparently support single-GPU and multi-GPU regimes.  Collectively, these snippets describe a canonical pre-training flow that initializes the Megatron runtime, parses arguments, constructs the model and tokenizer, and restores weights through an optimized distributed checkpoint loader before executing the main pretrain loop.",
