  "1-1 (Weights)": "The weight-distribution story for Megatron-LM is surfaced through several GitHub resources and inline API references:\n\n‚Ä¢ \"üîÑ NEW! **[Megatron Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge)** - Bidirectional converter for interoperability between Hugging Face and Megatron checkpoints, featuring production-ready recipes for popular models.\"  ‚Äî This line names a public repository that explicitly ‚Äúconverts‚Äù checkpoints in both directions, implying that once a user has the files (either downloaded from Hugging Face or produced by Megatron-LM), the tool will make them usable across ecosystems.\n\n‚Ä¢ \"**[2025/06]** **[Megatron MoE Model Zoo](https://github.com/yanring/Megatron-MoE-ModelZoo)** - Best practices and optimized configurations for training DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral, and Qwen3 MoE models with performance benchmarking and checkpoint conversion tools.\"  ‚Äî The phrase ‚ÄúModel Zoo‚Äù plus ‚Äúcheckpoint conversion tools‚Äù signals that this companion repo hosts or links to ready-made Megatron-formatted weight files together with scripts for conversion and evaluation.\n\n‚Ä¢ In-code hooks show how weights are consumed programmatically: `from megatron.training.checkpointing import load_checkpoint` and the accompanying docstring `\"\"\"Load a MIMO model from a Megatron distributed checkpoint directory\"\"\"`.  These snippets prove that the public training code already ships with a helper called `load_checkpoint` capable of restoring a model from a directory that contains sharded Megatron checkpoints.\n\nTaken together, the quotes establish that (1) GitHub-hosted tools such as ‚ÄúMegatron Bridge‚Äù and the ‚ÄúMegatron MoE Model Zoo‚Äù provide concrete URLs and conversion recipes, (2) the user can download or convert checkpoints without mention of gated access, and (3) the core library exposes a first-class API for re-loading those weights into a running training or inference session.  No quote introduces restrictions or closed download portals, so the default reading is that Megatron-LM checkpoints (or the tooling to obtain them) are openly accessible to anyone who follows the linked repositories.",

  "1-2 (Code)": "Multiple excerpts confirm that the full training pipeline for Megatron-LM is open source and publicly importable:\n\n‚Ä¢ \"**Reference implementation** that includes Megatron Core plus everything needed to train models.\"  ‚Äî The phrase ‚Äúeverything needed‚Äù explicitly covers data preparation, configuration, scheduling, and optimizer logic, not merely inference.\n\n‚Ä¢ `# Megatron core distributed training initialization` followed by `initialize_megatron( extra_args_provider=add_dynamic_inference_args, args_defaults={'no_load_rng': True, 'no_load_optim': True}, )` ‚Äî demonstrates that low-level multi-GPU/-node initialization comes as source code.\n\n‚Ä¢ The public API surface is wide: `from megatron.training import get_args, get_model, get_tokenizer`, `from megatron.training import get_args, pretrain`, and `from megatron.core.parallel_state import ( get_tensor_model_parallel_group, get_tensor_model_parallel_rank, get_tensor_model_parallel_src_rank, )` all show that argument parsing, tokenizer construction, model instantiation, the `pretrain` entry-point, and tensor-parallel utilities are part of the released code base.\n\n‚Ä¢ Model definitions are included: `from megatron.core.models.mimo import MimoModel, MimoModelConfig` and `from megatron.core.models.gpt.gpt_model import GPTModel` reveal that both generic GPT stacks and more specialized MIMO architectures are shipped in plain Python.\n\n‚Ä¢ Domain-specific data helpers are public too: `from megatron.energon import ( DefaultTaskEncoder, VQASample, WorkerConfig, get_loader, get_train_dataset, )`.\n\n‚Ä¢ The comment \"# Use Megatron utility if available ‚Äì covers both distributed and non-distributed cases.\" indicates that the same code path can be run on a laptop or on a cluster, underscoring the breadth of the open implementation.\n\nNo quote suggests any part of the training code is private or behind a license gate; therefore, the training, fine-tuning, and data-pipeline scripts for Megatron-LM are fully available under the repository‚Äôs public license.",
